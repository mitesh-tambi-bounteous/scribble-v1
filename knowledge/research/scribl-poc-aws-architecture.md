# Research note: Scribl D2C production AWS architecture and TCO

Ingested from the POC architecture README and cost model (canonical for the B1
harness and B2 build stages). The PNG diagram and the xlsx workbook are preserved
verbatim under product/inputs/reference/poc/architecture/; the workbook is the source
of truth for all cost figures. The 1-week POC seeds toward this target by running a
thin slice (API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB, web export on S3/CloudFront).

## Request path and tiers

Global edge: Route 53 -> WAF -> CloudFront (latency routing to nearest active
region). Regional ingress: Application Load Balancer per region per environment.
Application tier: Amazon EKS, one cluster per environment (prod in every active
region; dev and stage stay in Ohio; cluster count grows 3 -> 5 as regions come
online). AI: EKS -> Amazon Bedrock -> Claude (drawing vision-read/caption,
moderation, daily prompt generation). Auth: Cognito user pools per region.

Data tier: Aurora Serverless v2 (relational system of record, prod ACUs scale with
DAU above a 10-ACU HA floor); DynamoDB (high-velocity on-demand, stays small);
ElastiCache Redis (always-on); OpenSearch (search + log analytics); S3 media
(cumulative). Async lane: daily prompt-gen -> EventBridge -> SQS -> EKS; SNS ->
Pinpoint for the push habit loop. Observability: CloudWatch, Managed Prometheus,
Managed Grafana, X-Ray. Analytics/ML data lake (S3 -> Glue -> Athena, plus
SageMaker) centralized in us-east-2 only, gated on after Year 1 (default month 13).

Multi-region: launches us-east-2 (Ohio), expands prod to eu-west-2 (London) ~month
13 and ap-southeast-1 (Singapore) ~month 25.

## Cost / TCO (from the v3 estimate workbook, source of truth)

30-month run-rate model (Oct 2026 - Mar 2029), built bottom-up at us-east-2 list
prices, no partner discount.

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| 30-month TCO | approx $2,450,084 |
| AI App as % of TCO | approx 68.8% |
| Run rate at launch (M1) | approx $9,107 / mo |
| Run rate at scale (M30) | approx $182,633 / mo |

Cost drivers: AI inference dominates (~60% of the 30-month total, ~two-thirds at
full scale). Within AI spend at 5M users: Sonnet 4.6 vision ~78% (~14.6M
calls/mo), Haiku 4.5 moderation ~22% (~26.6M calls/mo), Opus 4.8 daily prompt
generation <0.1% (~150 calls/mo). User scaling 8k -> 5M registered over 30 months
(DAU ~25%, MAU ~45% of registered). Three always-on environments give a fixed
compute/database baseline floor.

Note: this production architecture is Bedrock-fronted (EKS -> Bedrock -> Claude),
which is consistent with the AWS co-funding posture; the technical implementation
plan defaults to Direct Anthropic API behind the provider abstraction with the
hosting choice resolved early but not blocking. Both remain a config choice behind
the same Messages API shape.
