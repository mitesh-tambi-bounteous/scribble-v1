# knowledge/

The project's knowledge base: research, reference material, and ingested
transcripts. This is the brain's long-term memory for the engagement. Content is
written and queried via the `/ingest` and `/query` commands in `.claude`.

Adapted from the brain vault's knowledge folder.

## Subdirectories

| Dir | Holds |
|-----|-------|
| `raw/` | Raw, unprocessed snapshots of ingested sources (URLs, docs, dumps) before they are distilled |
| `research/` | Synthesized research notes and the project research dossier (P3) |
| `wiki/` | Distilled concept, tool, and reference pages that compound over time |
| `articles/` | Long-form writeups and reference articles relevant to the project |
| `meetings/` | Client and internal meeting transcripts, each with extracted learnings and a "Suggested action items" section |

## Conventions

- Every ingested source keeps provenance: where it came from and when.
- `raw/` snapshots are verbatim captures kept outside the knowledge-bundle
  boundary: provenance lives in HTML comments and no YAML frontmatter is
  required there.
- Linking convention: cross-references between knowledge files are relative
  markdown links (`[text](path.md)`), not `[[wikilinks]]`.
- Meeting ingest extracts a "Suggested action items" section. A human promotes
  those to `tracking/stories/`; they are not auto-created.
- Durable, reusable learnings (across projects) belong in `patterns/`, not here.
