# Scribl D2C — Technical Implementation Plan

**Status:** Draft
**Date:** 2026-06-10
**Companion document:** [Architecture Plan](architecture-plan.md)
**Scope baseline:** Lean MLP, extension-ready
**Methodology:** ARC AI-SDLC

---

## 1. Overview and timeline

This plan turns the architecture into a build sequence, a story-level backlog, and an AI cost model. It assumes the team described in the Team Model (~6.0 FTE, with two Mobile Engineers) running the ARC AI-SDLC methodology with Claude Code as the volume engine.

| Phase | Weeks | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shape | 1-2 | Interactive prototype, **week-1 spikes (Skia canvas on a cheap Android device; clickable "would you do this daily" loop test)**, locked backlog, finalized architecture, PKB configured |
| Build | 3-12 | Beta-quality MLP across five vertical streams |
| Beta + Launch | 13-14 | Internal alpha, 500-1,000 user beta, App Store + Play submission (Sept 1), public launch (Sept 15) |
| Evolve | 15+ | 30-day stabilization, board retention report (Oct), methodology retrospective |

Critical path: App Store submission by **September 1** to protect the September 15 launch. Build ends week 12; weeks 13-14 are alpha/beta and store review buffer.

---

## 2. Repository and project structure

Single monorepo, so the shared types and event taxonomy stay in lockstep across mobile, backend, and AI service.

```

```

The PKB (Project Knowledge Base) is configured for Scribl in Shape: architecture decisions, API contracts, the event taxonomy, and design patterns are queryable by all ARC agents and engineers from day one.

---

## 3. Environment and tooling

| Concern | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Mobile build | **Expo + EAS development build with config plugins** (supports Skia, secure storage, push, and STT without a bare eject) |
| Backend language | TypeScript (Lambda), Python (AI service) |
| Operational data store | Aurora Serverless v2 (PostgreSQL) + Prisma |
| Analytics | PostHog (OSS product-analytics SDK) for the MLP; bespoke warehouse deferred (see Section 6) |
| IaC | AWS CDK (TypeScript) |
| Package management | pnpm workspaces (monorepo) |
| AI development | Claude Code as the primary dev tool for every engineer (ARC methodology) |
| Design | Claude Design (claude.ai/design) for screen generation in Shape; Figma for the spec of record |
| Test | Jest + React Native Testing Library (mobile), Vitest/Jest (services), Detox or Maestro (E2E device), pytest (AI service) |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions → CDK deploy + EAS build |

---

## 4. Build streams and backlog

Five vertical feature streams plus a foundations stream, each a slice through mobile + API + infra so teams run in parallel. Stories use the repo's `####` + `[Agent: ...]`-style convention is for agent definitions; product stories here are listed as epics with story-level tasks. Each story in Jira gets detailed subtasks with file paths and verify steps (per the team's spec-driven standard).

### Stream 0 — Foundations (weeks 3-5, front-loaded)

| Story | Key tasks | Files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CDK scaffolding | Stacks: networking, data, api, ai, events, analytics, obs; dev/staging/prod stages | `infra/` |
| Auth baseline | Cognito user pool, Apple + Google federation, JWT authorizer | `infra/`, `services/api/auth/` |
| Aurora Serverless v2 (PostgreSQL) | Cluster + schema for the operational access patterns; Prisma schema and row types. Submit-to-unlock as a transactional `EXISTS` check. | `infra/data/`, `packages/shared-types/` |
| Media storage | S3 buckets, CloudFront, pre-signed URL issuer | `infra/data/`, `services/api/media/` |
| Claude client package | Provider-abstraction interface; **one hardened adapter for MLP** (Direct API, pending hosting decision); seam retained for a second adapter | `packages/claude-client/` |
| Event taxonomy + analytics SDK | Versioned analytics events; **product-analytics SDK (PostHog) wired for MLP** retention/funnel; bespoke warehouse deferred (see Section 6) | `packages/analytics-events/` |
| Observability | X-Ray/OTel tracing, CloudWatch dashboards, structured logging, per-call Claude token logging | `infra/obs/`, `services/*` |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions: lint, test, CDK deploy, EAS build to TestFlight/Play internal | `.github/workflows/` |

### Stream A — Auth and onboarding (weeks 4-6)

- Sign-up / sign-in (email + Apple + Google); onboarding tutorial; channel-invitation accept flow.
- Mobile: `apps/mobile/src/features/onboarding/`. API: `services/api/auth/`, `services/api/channels/invite`.

### Stream B — Daily prompt and creative response (weeks 4-8) — the core loop

- **Prompt pipeline:** EventBridge schedule → AI service generates candidates (Claude/Opus) → editorial gate → canonical prompt in the operational store → active at release.
- **Response capture:** Skia drawing canvas (native module), text response (char-limited), voice memo (on-device STT, char/length-limited). **Recommendation: cut voice from the MLP or scope it iOS-only** (Android on-device STT is OEM-variable; voice is roughly 10% of submissions). Decision pending.
- **Submit-to-unlock:** server-side conditional write; channel reads gated on submission existence.
- **Async AI:** on drawing submit, enqueue SQS → AI service vision response (Sonnet) → store reflection → notify.
- Mobile: `apps/mobile/src/features/{prompt,response}/`, `src/native/canvas/`. API: `services/api/{prompt,submit}/`. AI: `services/ai/{prompt_gen,vision,moderation}/`.

### Stream C — Social channels and reactions (weeks 6-10)

- Four channels (Personal Archive, Family, Friends, Co-Workers); channel response feed (post-unlock); standardized emoji reactions.
- Channel isolation enforced server-side; signed media URLs scoped to membership.
- Mobile: `apps/mobile/src/features/channels/`. API: `services/api/{channels,reactions}/`.

### Stream D — Streak and progression (weeks 8-12)

- Streak tracking, badges, milestones, stats; retention loops.
- Mobile: `apps/mobile/src/features/streaks/`. API: `services/api/streaks/`.

### Stream E — Push notification habit loop (weeks 8-12)

- Daily reminder (timezone-aware), friend activity, momentum/streak-at-risk re-engagement; notification preferences + quiet hours.
- Pinpoint campaigns + SNS transactional; APNs/FCM registration native module.
- Mobile: `apps/mobile/src/features/notifications/`, `src/native/push/`. API/infra: `services/api/notifications/`, `infra/events/`.

### Stream F — Admin, analytics, moderation surface (weeks 10-14)

- Internal metrics dashboard (DAU, retention, K-factor, completion); content moderation review queue; user reporting + block/mute.
- QuickSight dashboards off the Athena warehouse; minimal internal admin (not enterprise admin, which is out of scope).

### Seam — Premium tier (weeks 12-14, conditional)

- Paywall, entitlement model, archive access, export tools. Ships at launch only if Phase 0 confirms it; otherwise the entitlement model is stubbed as a seam.

### Out of MLP scope (seams only)

Agentic personalized follow-ups, AI archive search, Exciting Artifact composition, enterprise admin/SSO/dashboards, Slack/Teams, Booster Pack marketplace.

## 5. Key API contracts (sketch)

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/prompt/today` | GET | user | Returns active prompt + caller's submission status |
| `/submit` | POST | user | Creates submission; enforces submit-to-unlock; returns pre-signed media URL if needed |
| `/channels` | GET | user | Caller's channels + membership |
| `/channels/{id}/responses?promptId=` | GET | user | 403 unless caller has submitted for that prompt |
| `/channels/{id}/invite` | POST | user | Issues signed expiring invite token |
| `/responses/{id}/reactions` | POST | user (channel member) | Append emoji reaction |
| `/streaks` | GET | user | Streak, badges, stats |
| `/me/notifications` | PUT | user | Preferences, quiet hours |
| WS `event/{eventId}` | WSS | user | Enterprise event-mode broadcast. **Recommended out of the MLP; keep as a seam.** |

Internal (AI service): `generate(prompt_spec)`, `moderate(content, type)`, `describe_image(s3_key, prompt_context)` behind the provider abstraction.

Submit-to-unlock is a server-side precondition: the channel-read path returns 403 unless a submission row exists for `(user, prompt)`, a transactional `EXISTS` check in Postgres.

---

## 6. Analytics pipeline implementation

**MLP approach:** lead with a product-analytics SDK; defer the bespoke warehouse (see the Architecture Plan, analytics section).

- Typed events in `packages/analytics-events/` (versioned). Client and server both import. The taxonomy feeds either backend, so it is built regardless.
- **Product-analytics SDK (PostHog, OSS, self-hostable)** is the MLP system of record for retention cohorts and funnels. It delivers D1/D7/D30 and the prompt funnel out of the box, with no pipeline to build.
- Client batches events; server emits server-side events (submit, moderation outcome, push delivered).
- Launch dashboards: DAU/WAU, D1/D7/D30 retention cohorts, prompt funnel (open → start → submit), share rate, K-factor, premium-intent signals — all from the SDK for the MLP.
- The **30-day retention curve** report (board, October) is a PostHog cohort export for the MLP.
- **Deferred:** the Kinesis → S3 → Glue → Athena → QuickSight warehouse, added only when a question arises that the SDK genuinely cannot answer. CloudTrail and per-call Claude token logging stay regardless.

---

## 7. Testing strategy

| Layer | Approach |
| --- | --- |
| Unit | TDD per ARC methodology; Jest/Vitest (TS), pytest (Python) |
| Component | React Native Testing Library |
| E2E device | Maestro or Detox on the real-device matrix |
| Device matrix | iOS + Android, including low-end Android. **Canvas spike on a cheap Android device in week 1**; full real-device matrix from **week 6** (canvas behavior diverges; emulators miss it) |
| AI feature eval | Claude-assisted eval design for moderation accuracy and vision-response quality; golden-set regression for moderation. Includes a quality bar for the drawing reflection (tone, and behavior on a scribble / blank canvas / off-tone drawing) |
| Load | Simulate the daily thundering herd before beta (read-heavy at prompt release). The 2,000-concurrent event-mode test drops if event mode is cut from the MLP |
| Security | **Channel-isolation tests (launch-blocking)**, submit-to-unlock bypass attempts, signed-URL scoping (including under multi-channel share once the channel model is decided) |

Human QA owns the golden path; automated test generation covers breadth. Channel-isolation failures are a privacy breach, not a bug, so those tests are a launch gate (see Section 11).

---

## 8. CI/CD and release

- GitHub Actions: lint → test → CDK synth/deploy (dev on PR, staging on merge, prod on tag) → EAS build.
- Mobile: EAS Build → TestFlight (iOS) and Play internal track (Android) for alpha/beta; promote to production tracks for launch.
- App Store compliance and in-app-purchase config begin **week 11** (two-week buffer before Sept 1 submission).
- Release checklist: privacy nutrition labels; UGC moderation policy published; reporting/block/mute present; AI-content disclosure where required; **third-party-AI data-sharing consent surface and disclosure (Apple 5.1.2(i), Nov 2025)**; **named moderation-queue owner with a documented ~24h action SLA (Apple 1.2)**; channel-isolation tests green (launch-blocking).

## 9. AI services, cost, and token consumption

This section is both the engineering cost model and the input to the **Anthropic funding narrative** (the MAP-style "services used + projected spend" document). It has two halves: **product-side Claude** (in the app) and **dev-side Claude** (Claude Code building the app). All figures use current list pricing; on-spec terms and any Anthropic credits are layered on separately.

### 9.1 Model selection and unit pricing

| Model | Model ID (Direct / Bedrock) | Input $/1M | Output $/1M | Role in Scribl |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Opus 4.8 | `claude-opus-4-8` / `anthropic.claude-opus-4-8` | $5.00 | $25.00 | Daily prompt generation (once/day, quality-critical) |
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | `claude-sonnet-4-6` / `anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6` | $3.00 | $15.00 | Drawing interpretation + response (vision) |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | `claude-haiku-4-5` / `anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5` | $1.00 | $5.00 | Content moderation (high volume) |

Cost levers available on all three:

- **Prompt caching:** cache reads cost ~0.1x input; writes cost 1.25x (5-min TTL). The universal daily prompt and shared system context are identical across all users that day, so they cache extremely well.
- **Batch API:** 50% off for non-latency-sensitive work (e.g., overnight moderation backfills, prompt-candidate generation).
- **Right-sized models:** moderation on Haiku, vision on Sonnet, only the once-a-day prompt on Opus.

### 9.2 Product-side touchpoints and per-event token estimates

| Touchpoint | Model | Frequency | Est. input tokens | Est. output tokens |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Daily prompt generation | Opus 4.8 | 1 batch/day (≈10 candidates) | ~2,000 | ~1,500 |
| Content moderation (text/transcript) | Haiku 4.5 | per submission | ~600 | ~50 |
| Content moderation (drawing) | Haiku 4.5 | per drawing | ~1,800 (incl. image) | ~60 |
| Drawing interpretation + response | Sonnet 4.6 | per drawing | ~2,200 (incl. image + prompt ctx) | ~350 |

Notes:
- A phone-canvas drawing is a modest image (~1,500 image tokens at standard resolution); we do not need high-resolution vision for an encouraging reflection, which keeps image-token cost down.
- Voice is transcribed on-device; only the transcript is moderated (text path). No audio tokens.
- Submission mix assumed **60% drawing / 30% text / 10% voice**.

### 9.3 Volume and monthly cost projections

Assume ~1 completed submission per DAU per day (completion already implied by "active"). 30 days/month.

**Beta — 1,000 DAU**

| Touchpoint | Calls/month | Monthly cost (list) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prompt generation (Opus) | 30 | < $5 |
| Moderation (Haiku, all ~30k submissions) | ~30,000 | ~$45 |
| Drawing response (Sonnet, 600/day) | ~18,000 | ~$215 |
| **Product-side total** | | **~$265 / month** |

**90-day target — 10,000 DAU**

| Touchpoint | Calls/month | Monthly cost (list) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prompt generation (Opus) | 30 | < $5 |
| Moderation (Haiku, ~300k submissions) | ~300,000 | ~$450 |
| Drawing response (Sonnet, 6,000/day) | ~180,000 | ~$2,130 |
| **Product-side total (no caching)** | | **~$2,585 / month** |
| **With prompt caching on shared context** | | **~$2,050-2,150 / month** |

Caching math: ~1,000 of the ~2,200 Sonnet input tokens per drawing call are the shared daily-prompt + system context. Cached reads at ~0.1x save roughly $0.0027 per call × 180,000 ≈ **~$480/month** at 10k DAU. The saving grows linearly with DAU.

**Stretch — 50,000 DAU**

| Touchpoint | Monthly cost (list) |
| --- | --- |
| Moderation (Haiku) | ~$2,250 |
| Drawing response (Sonnet, with caching) | ~$8,200 |
| Prompt generation (Opus) | < $5 |
| **Product-side total** | **~$10,500 / month** |

Headline: AI cost is dominated by **drawing interpretation (Sonnet vision)**, not prompt generation. The universal-prompt design keeps the most "AI-feeling" feature (one prompt for everyone) essentially free; the spend scales with how many people draw, which is exactly the engagement we want to pay for.

### 9.4 Cost-control playbook

1. **Cache the daily shared context** on every Sonnet vision call (~20-25% input saving, growing with scale).
2. **Moderate cheaply.** Haiku is 5x cheaper than Sonnet on input; keep moderation on Haiku and only escalate flagged content.
3. **Batch the non-urgent.** Prompt-candidate generation and any moderation backfill go through the Batch API at 50% off.
4. **Async, not inline.** Vision responses are an enhancement; if cost spikes, they can be sampled (e.g., respond to a percentage) without breaking the core loop.
5. **Per-call token logging** feeds a cost dashboard so we see spend per touchpoint per day, not a surprise at month end.
6. **Image-token discipline.** Export canvas drawings at the resolution the reflection actually needs; do not send high-res unless a feature requires it.

### 9.5 Dev-side Claude (Claude Code) — the methodology spend

The ARC methodology runs the entire build on Claude Code. This is real, ongoing Anthropic consumption and is part of the funding story: a Claude-Code-native team shipping a consumer app from scratch.

- ~5-7 engineers using Claude Code as the primary dev tool across the ~10-week build plus Evolve.
- Heavy agentic coding consumption is the largest single Anthropic line item on this engagement, larger than product-side AI during the build months.
- This spend is captured for the Anthropic narrative as "development-side Claude usage," distinct from product-side API spend. (We will instrument actual consumption during Shape to replace this estimate with measured numbers, per the methodology-documentation goal.)

### 9.6 Anthropic funding narrative input (MAP-style)

The deliverable for Anthropic is the table below: every Claude touchpoint, product-side and dev-side, with projected volume and spend at the target scale. Anthropic computes ROI on funding from this; we do not argue "Claude over OpenAI."

| Surface | Claude service | Model | Driver | Spend signal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product | Daily prompt generation | Opus 4.8 | 1/day universal | Low, fixed |
| Product | Drawing interpretation | Sonnet 4.6 (vision) | per drawing submission | Primary, scales with DAU |
| Product | Content moderation | Haiku 4.5 | per submission | Moderate, scales with DAU |
| Product (post-launch seam) | Personalized follow-ups | Opus/Sonnet (agentic, memory) | per engaged user | Activates with full-build ceiling |
| Product (Q1 2027 seam) | Collective artifact | Sonnet/Opus | per channel event | Future |
| Dev | Claude Code build | Opus/Sonnet | per engineer-day | Largest during build |

### 9.7 Bedrock vs Direct API — cost, feature, and privacy note

- **Same Messages API shape** on both, so the provider abstraction makes this a config choice, not a rewrite. Build one hardened adapter for the MLP; keep the seam for a second.
- **Pricing** is comparable; the decision is driven by the AWS co-funding conversation and data-residency, not by raw token price.
- **Privacy and compliance:** this is not only a cost decision. Every submission is personal data shared with a third-party AI; Apple 5.1.2(i) requires disclosure and explicit consent. Direct API is an external data path, Bedrock keeps the call in-VPC, so the hosting choice changes the consent/disclosure story and the store-review posture (see the Architecture Plan, Claude integration and security sections).
- **Caveat:** prompt caching can behave differently on Bedrock if third-party tooling mutates prompt headers (the known cache-break issue). Keep the adapter's request shape clean so the projected caching savings hold on either path.
- **Recommendation:** default to **Direct Anthropic API** for cleanest caching, full feature parity, and the cleanest Anthropic reference story; switch to **Bedrock** or **Claude Platform on AWS** if AWS co-funding or the privacy/data-residency posture makes in-AWS the better outcome. No app change either way.

## 10. Risk register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Product loop unvalidated / cold start** | Med | **High (product, kills the fundraise)** | Week-1 clickable "would you do this daily" test; explicit empty-channel first-session design before build lock; do not wait for the wk-13 beta to learn the mechanic is wrong |
| Drawing canvas perf on low-end Android | Med | High | Skia; **canvas spike on cheap Android wk 1**; real-device from wk 6; native fallback → 2nd mobile eng |
| App Store / Play UGC + AI review rejection | Med | High | Third-party-AI consent (5.1.2(i)); moderation owner + ~24h SLA (1.2); reporting/block/mute; policy; channel-isolation tests launch-blocking; submit Sept 1; 2-wk buffer |
| COPPA / minors scope change | Med | High | **Gating decision before build lock**, not a Phase-0 footnote; can move launch by months |
| Bedrock vs Direct churn | Low (mitigated) | Med | One adapter for the MLP behind the provider abstraction; now also a privacy/compliance call |
| AI cost runaway | Low-Med | Med | Tiering, caching, async sampling, Batch, cost dashboard |
| Single backend engineer unavailable wks 8-12 | Med | High | DevOps absorbs; Claude Code amplifies backend/infra; 2nd backend eng is the next surge add (after the 2nd mobile eng now in the core team) |
| Agentic follow-up pulled into MLP late | Med | High | Scope lock before wk 3; seam only |
| Engineering Lead overload (3 roles) | Med | Med | Schedule AI-tooling upkeep; AI eng seat is the release valve |
| Day-7 retention < 30% at beta | Med | High (product) | Iterate prompt + notification strategy in wks 13-14 before public launch; but the week-1 loop test is the real mitigation |

## 11. Definition of done and launch criteria

**Story DoD:** code reviewed (Claude-assisted + human), unit + component tests passing, analytics events emitted, runs on the iOS + Android device matrix, **channel-isolation and submit-to-unlock tests green (launch-blocking, no regressions)**.

**Launch criteria (Sept 15):**
- Core loop (prompt → create → submit → unlock → channel view → react) works on iOS and Android.
- Submit-to-unlock and channel isolation verified (channel-isolation tests are a launch gate).
- Moderation live on every submission with a **decided** fail policy (gating decision, not TBD).
- Third-party-AI data-sharing consent surface present and disclosed (Apple 5.1.2(i)); named moderation-queue owner with a ~24h action SLA (Apple 1.2).
- Push habit loop operational (daily reminder + friend activity + momentum).
- Streaks/progression functional.
- Analytics emitting; retention cohorts/funnels live (product-analytics SDK).
- App Store + Play approved (submitted Sept 1).
- Beta Day-7 retention reviewed; if < 30%, prompt/notification iteration completed before public launch.
- Security baseline: TLS, AES-256 at rest, CloudTrail audit, GDPR/CCPA export+delete.

**Evolve deliverables:** 30-day retention curve report (board, October), AI-SDLC methodology retrospective (Bounteous internal), Q4 roadmap scoping.

## 12. Gating decisions before build lock

These are gating decisions (detailed in the Architecture Plan). **Block the build until resolved:** COPPA/minors in scope; agentic follow-up MLP-or-post-launch (lock before the build begins); channel model (frozen before submission build begins); moderation fail policy. **Resolve early, do not block:** Claude hosting (Direct vs Bedrock vs Platform-on-AWS, now also a privacy/compliance call); operational data store (Aurora Serverless v2 recommended); premium timing; voice in MLP (cut/iOS-only recommended); MLP scope cuts (event mode out, PostHog over the warehouse). Each confirmed decision is captured as a recorded architecture decision.

**Week-1 spikes (before the SOW locks):** the Skia canvas on a cheap Android device, and a clickable prototype tested for "would you do this daily." Both are cheap and both can invalidate the plan early, which is the point.
