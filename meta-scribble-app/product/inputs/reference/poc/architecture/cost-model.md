# Scribl D2C — Infrastructure Cost / TCO Model

Source of truth: [`Scribl-D2C-AWS-Estimate-v3.xlsx`](./Scribl-D2C-AWS-Estimate-v3.xlsx)
(tabs: README, Summary, Assumptions, Drivers, Costs). All figures below are
distilled from that workbook — open it to change assumptions or trace any line.

**Model basis:** a 30-month run-rate / TCO model, **Oct 2026 – Mar 2029**, built
bottom-up from six consumption pillars (+ a Data Lake / ML research workstream that
switches on after Year 1). Unit prices anchored to **AWS us-east-2 (Ohio) list
prices and Anthropic rates, validated June 2026. No partner discount applied.**

## Headline numbers

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| 30-month TCO | **≈ $2,450,084** |
| AI App as % of TCO | **≈ 68.8%** |
| Run rate at launch (M1) | **≈ $9,107 / mo** |
| Run rate at scale (M30) | **≈ $182,633 / mo** |

## Monthly run-rate by pillar ($/mo)

| Pillar | Year 1 avg | Year 2 avg | Yr3 H1 avg | At scale (M30) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Compute (EKS) | 5,012 | 8,046 | 10,529 | 11,080 |
| Security (Cognito, WAF) | 561 | 5,924 | 9,210 | 9,971 |
| Networking (ALB, transfer) | 981 | 7,563 | 12,674 | 13,845 |
| Database (DynamoDB, Aurora) | 3,712 | 5,877 | 8,046 | 8,553 |
| Storage (S3) | 50 | 797 | 1,984 | 2,375 |
| AI App (Bedrock + Claude) | 7,118 | 72,944 | 120,739 | 132,340 |
| Data Lake / ML research | 0 | 2,091 | 3,810 | 4,470 |
| **Total run rate** | **17,434** | **103,243** | **166,992** | **182,633** |

## Cumulative spend & unit economics

| Metric | Year 1 (12 mo) | Year 2 (12 mo) | Yr3 H1 (6 mo) | 30-mo total |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Total cost (TCO) | $209,211 | $1,238,920 | $1,001,953 | **$2,450,084** |
| Registered users (period end) | 1,000,000 | 3,900,000 | 5,000,000 | 5,000,000 |
| Cost per registered user (period) | $0.21 | $0.32 | $0.20 | $0.49 |
| Submissions in period | 17,157,000 | 175,932,400 | 145,608,400 | 338,697,800 |
| Cost per submission | $0.0122 | $0.0070 | $0.0069 | $0.0072 |

## AI inference breakdown (the dominant pillar)

AI inference is ~60% of the 30-month total and ~two-thirds at full scale. At default
assumptions and 5M users:

| Inference feature | Model | Fires on | Calls/mo @ 5M | Share of AI $ |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| Daily prompt generation | Opus 4.8 | Once per day, all users | ~150 | <0.1% |
| Drawing read + caption/headline | Sonnet 4.6 (vision) | Every drawing submitted | ~14.6M | ~78% |
| Content moderation | Haiku 4.5 | Every submission | ~26.6M | ~22% |
| Personalized follow-ups | Agentic (memory) | Post-launch; **not modelled** | — | — |
| Exciting Artifact composition | Generative | Q1 2027; **not modelled** | — | — |

The daily prompt is generated once for all users (~150 calls/mo, ~$5), so prompt
generation is negligible. The cost is per-item: a vision read on every drawing and a
moderation check on every submission. The two post-launch features are listed for
completeness; neither is in the cost numbers.

## Key drivers & assumptions

- **User scaling:** 8k → 5M registered users over 30 months. **DAU ≈ 25%** of
  registered; **MAU ≈ 45%**.
- **Regional expansion:** 1 → 3 regions. Premium vs Ohio: **eu-west-2 (London)
  ~8%** (live ~month 13), **ap-southeast-1 (Singapore) ~18%** (live ~month 25).
  Only the traffic share in a region carries its premium, so the blended effect is a
  few percent, not the headline premium. Dev/stage and the data lake stay in Ohio.
- **Always-on baseline:** three environments (dev, stage, prod) give compute and
  database a fixed floor; gross floor ~$11k/mo at launch (~$9.5k demand-driven, the
  rest reserved launch-readiness headroom, editable on the Assumptions tab).
- **Storage only climbs:** all media is retained, so S3 grows even if DAU flattens;
  effective rate blends S3 Standard with Infrequent-Access lifecycle tiering.
- **Data Lake / ML** is gated to start after Year 1 (default month 13); compute is
  modest — the consent / de-identification work behind it sits outside this model.
