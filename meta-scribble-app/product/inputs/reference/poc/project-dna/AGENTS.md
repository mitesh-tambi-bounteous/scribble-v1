# Scribl D2C POC — agent operating notes

This repo is built with AI agents (Claude Code). Read CLAUDE.md first.

## Recommended skills (OSS only)
- Expo official **knowledge** skills (architecture, native UI, tailwind setup,
  expo-module, upgrading). Install: `claude plugin install expo@claude-plugins-official`.
  Do NOT use the EAS deployment / cicd / update-health skills.
- Callstack `agent-skills` (RN performance + best practices).

## Do
- Prefer Expo Router file-based routes and React Native Reusables components.
- Keep the drawing canvas (Skia) responsive — profile on a real device.
- Keep state in Zustand; keep data access behind a thin client over the mock API.

## Don't
- Don't add EAS config, `eas.json`, or the remote Expo MCP.
- Don't depend on `ohah/react-native-mcp` (immature: ~6 stars, stale).
- Don't introduce a web→native split — one codebase, web is an export target.

## Verify before "done"
- App runs on web AND at least one device/simulator.
- Drawing feels smooth on-device; submit-to-unlock actually gates the feed.
