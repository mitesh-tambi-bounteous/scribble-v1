# Scribl D2C — Team Model

**Status:** Draft
**Date:** 2026-06-10
**Methodology:** ARC AI-SDLC
**Companion documents:** Architecture Plan, Technical Implementation Plan

---

## Team and Timeline

Lean configuration of ~6.0 FTE running the ARC AI-SDLC methodology, with Claude Code as the primary development tool for every engineer. 14 weeks to the September 15 public launch.

### Primary Recommendation

| Role | What they own |
| --- | --- |
| Engagement Lead | Senior client relationship. Commercial terms, scope, methodology fidelity. |
| PM | Human Spec, backlog management, discovery conversations, scope boundary (MLP vs post-launch), App Store coordination. Shared. |
| Engineering Lead | React Native architecture, cross-platform integration leadership, Claude pipeline ownership (prompt generation, vision, moderation), PKB setup, final code-review call. Floats to the highest-risk stream. |
| Mobile Engineer 1 | Creative response stream: the Skia drawing canvas (highest-risk component), text and voice capture, streak and progression UI. |
| Mobile Engineer 2 | Auth and onboarding, social channels and reactions, the notification client. |
| Backend/API Engineer | AWS API layer, channel data model, content storage, push backend, analytics wiring, CDK infrastructure. Heavily amplified by Claude Code. |
| DevOps/AWS | CI/CD, AWS CDK infrastructure, App Store and Play pipelines, observability. Shared. AWS code coaching liaison. |
| UX/Product Designer | Shape-phase prototype and UX direction. Exits early Build (week 6). Claude Design for screen generation; Figma for the spec of record. |
| QA | Validation strategy, iOS/Android device matrix, beta testing, eval design for Claude features. Shared. |
| **Total: ~6.0 FTE** | Two Mobile Engineers so the parallel feature streams are genuinely parallel, and so the drawing canvas (the highest-risk component) and the cross-platform device matrix both get dedicated focus. |

**The second Mobile Engineer is in the core team, not the ceiling.** Every feature stream has a mobile surface, so mobile is the real parallelism bottleneck. The canvas is the highest-risk component and may need a native fallback, and the iOS/Android device matrix is the top QA risk. Claude Code amplifies the backend and infrastructure work more than real-device mobile work, so the human capacity is best added on mobile.

### Phase coverage

| Role | Shape (Wks 1-2) | Build (Wks 3-12) | Beta/Launch (Wks 13-14) | Evolve (ongoing) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Engagement Lead | 0.25 | 0.25 | 0.25 | 0.1 |
| PM | Full | Half | Half | Light |
| Engineering Lead | Full | Full | Full | Half |
| Mobile Engineer 1 | Half | Full | Full | Half |
| Mobile Engineer 2 | Half | Full | Full | -- |
| Backend/API Engineer | Half | Full | Full | Half |
| DevOps/AWS | -- | Half | Full | Half |
| UX/Product Designer | Full | Half (wks 3-6) | -- | -- |
| QA | -- | Half | Full | Half |

### Full Build Ceiling

Add this seat if discovery confirms that agentic personalized follow-ups are in MLP scope, or if Anthropic reference depth requires deeper Claude integration than the Engineering Lead can carry alone.

| Additional seat | FTE | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AI/Claude Integration Engineer | 1.0 (Build) | Agentic memory, personalized follow-up pipeline, or multi-turn Claude features confirmed in MLP scope |

**With the additional AI seat at Build peak: ~7.0 FTE.**

### How the team runs

**Shape (weeks 1-2).** The deliverable is a working interactive prototype, not a requirements document. Before the first kickoff call, the PM and Engineering Lead generate the bulk of the MLP backlog from the PRFAQ using ARC agents. The kickoff is a demo-and-react session.

Two spikes run in week 1, because both can invalidate the plan early and cheaply:
- The Skia drawing canvas on the cheapest Android device available, to confirm responsiveness before the build commits.
- A clickable prototype of the core loop, tested with real people for "would you do this daily," to validate the habit mechanic and the empty-channel first session before the build commits.

Architecture and the Claude integration specification are finalized, and the Project Knowledge Base is configured for Scribl. Build starts week 3 with a working prototype, a locked backlog, and a finalized architecture.

**Build (weeks 3-12).** All engineers full-time from week 3. Five parallel feature streams: auth and onboarding, creative response (canvas, text, voice), social channels and reactions, streak and progression, push notifications. Two Mobile Engineers make these streams genuinely parallel. AI is the volume engine throughout.

The cross-platform device matrix is the primary QA risk. Drawing-canvas behavior differs between iOS and Android in ways emulators do not surface, so real-device testing begins at week 6, not at beta. App Store compliance and in-app-purchase configuration begin at week 11.

**Beta and launch (weeks 13-14).** Internal alpha at week 13, then a 500-1,000 user beta. DevOps and QA scale to full allocation. If Day-7 retention is below 30% at beta, the prompt and notification strategy iterate before the September 15 launch.

**Evolve (post-launch).** Designer is off. Sustained team of roughly 3.0 FTE: Engineering Lead, one Mobile Engineer, Backend Engineer, DevOps (all part-time), PM (light), QA. The 30-day retention curves for the October investor pitch are the primary deliverable.

## Architecture

The full system design is in the Architecture Plan. This is the shape of it.

A daily creative-practice product (iOS and Android) on AWS, powered by Claude. One universal prompt per day; users respond by drawing, writing, or speaking; they unlock the day's responses in their private channels only after submitting their own.

### System shape

| Layer | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Mobile | React Native (one codebase, iOS + Android). Native modules only where required: drawing canvas (React Native Skia), secure storage, push registration, on-device speech-to-text. Expo development build with config plugins. |
| API | API Gateway + Lambda (Node/TypeScript), behind CloudFront. Cognito for auth, with Apple and Google sign-in. |
| AI service | A persistent Python service (ECS Fargate) that owns all Claude calls behind a provider abstraction. Prompt generation, drawing interpretation, and moderation. |
| Data | Aurora Serverless v2 (PostgreSQL) as the operational system of record. S3 for media (drawings, audio), delivered through CloudFront with membership-scoped signed URLs. |
| Async + events | EventBridge for the daily prompt scheduler and habit-loop triggers; SQS for moderation and AI-response work so submit never waits on AI; Pinpoint and SNS for push. |
| Analytics | A product-analytics SDK (PostHog) for the MLP retention and funnel metrics. |
| Observability | OpenTelemetry-friendly tracing, CloudWatch metrics and logs, and per-call Claude token logging. |

### Key architecture decisions

| Decision | Status |
| --- | --- |
| React Native primary; native modules only where required | Proposed |
| Serverless-first backend; a separate persistent service for the AI pipeline | Proposed |
| Aurora Serverless v2 (PostgreSQL) as the operational system of record; DynamoDB as a forward-scale option | Proposed |
| AWS CDK (TypeScript) for all infrastructure | Proposed |
| Submit-to-unlock enforced at the data and API layer, not the client | Proposed |
| One Claude provider adapter hardened for the MLP, behind an abstraction that also supports Bedrock and Claude Platform on AWS | Proposed |
| Drawing interpretation and moderation run asynchronously; submit never blocks on AI | Proposed |
| Model tiering: Opus for prompt generation, Sonnet for vision, Haiku for moderation | Proposed |
| Voice transcribed on-device; no audio sent to Claude in the MLP | Proposed |
| A product-analytics SDK is the analytics system of record for the MLP; the data warehouse is deferred | Proposed |

### Principles that hold the design together

- **The product comes first; Claude follows the product.** Claude earns its place where it is genuinely the right tool: prompt generation, drawing interpretation, and moderation.
- **Submit-to-unlock is a data-layer invariant**, enforced server-side, not a UI rule.
- **Privacy by channel.** The channels are isolation boundaries; a response is visible only to members of the channel it was shared to.
- **Claude is always optional and degrades gracefully.** The core habit loop survives a Claude outage; AI responses and moderation are enhancements with deterministic fallbacks.
- **Cost scales with engaged users, not registered users.** The universal daily prompt is generated once for everyone; AI cost tracks actual submissions.

### Security and privacy posture

- TLS in transit; AES-256 at rest (Aurora, S3, volumes); secrets in AWS Secrets Manager.
- Channel isolation authorized server-side on every read, with membership-scoped signed media URLs. Channel-isolation tests are treated as launch-blocking.
- Content moderation (Claude Haiku) on every submission; blocked content never reaches a channel.
- Third-party-AI data-sharing consent and disclosure, because every submission is sent to Claude (Apple Guideline 5.1.2(i)).
- UGC operations: report, block, published contact, and a moderation queue with a documented response time (Apple Guideline 1.2).
- GDPR/CCPA baseline: data export and account deletion, explicit consent, data minimization.

## Claude and Anthropic Impact

Where Claude creates value across the engagement: how we build, what we ship, and how we sustain it.

### Claude-powered development (the ARC methodology)

Claude Code is the primary development tool for every engineer. It is not a productivity add-on here; it is the method.

| Area | Claude role | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Feature development | Claude Code (all engineers) | AI is the volume engine. Engineers spec, review, and validate; Claude implements. |
| Shape-phase prototype | Claude Design | Screen generation in hours, not days. Interactive prototype ready for client reaction by the end of week 1. |
| Backlog generation | ARC agents | The bulk of the MLP backlog generated from the PRFAQ before kickoff. Kickoff is demo-and-react. |
| Project Knowledge Base | Claude-powered context layer | All agents stay project-aware throughout the build. |
| Code review and QA | Claude Code | Automated review pass on every PR; Claude-assisted eval design for AI feature validation. |

### Claude in the product

| Feature | Claude involvement | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Daily prompt generation | Claude (text), Opus | Core habit-loop driver. One universal prompt per day, generated ahead of time. |
| Drawing interpretation and response | Claude (vision), Sonnet | An encouraging reflection on the user's sketch. The genuine Claude differentiator. |
| Content moderation | Claude (text), Haiku | Safe community at scale; lets the social channels launch at day one. |
| Personalized follow-up notifications | Agentic (memory) | Habit reinforcement grounded in a user's own history. Post-launch roadmap. |
| Image composition ("Exciting Artifact") | Claude or generative AI | Turns submissions into shareable artifacts. Planned for later; not in MLP scope. |

---

## Recommendations

Recommendations from the architecture review, grouped by intent. Items that require a decision are listed in Decisions Needed.

### Tighten the MLP scope

- **Cut enterprise event mode from the MLP.** The real-time, 2,000-concurrent event feature is a different product from the daily consumer habit loop. Building and load-testing it is weeks of work on something out of MLP scope. Keep the design as a seam. This is the single biggest schedule reclaim available.
- **Lead with a product-analytics SDK; defer the bespoke data warehouse.** PostHog delivers the retention cohorts and funnel the board needs out of the box, with no pipeline to build. Add a warehouse later only if a question arises that the SDK cannot answer.
- **Cut voice from the MLP, or scope it to iOS only.** On-device transcription is reliable on iOS but high-variance across Android devices, and voice is only about 10% of submissions. Keep the feature on the roadmap.

### De-risk early

- **Front-load two week-1 spikes:** the Skia canvas on a cheap Android device, and a clickable "would you do this daily" prototype test. Both are cheap and both can invalidate assumptions before the build commits.
- **Design the cold-start first session.** A new user submits and then sees empty channels until they recruit people. This make-or-break first experience needs a deliberate design, not a late discovery.
- **Validate the core loop before build lock.** The whole fundraise rests on retention from a single daily prompt; do not wait for the week-13 beta to learn whether the mechanic works.

### Keep the build lean

- **Ship one Claude provider adapter for the MLP**, behind the abstraction, rather than maintaining three. Add a second when AWS co-funding closes.
- **Use Aurora Serverless v2 as the operational store.** The access patterns are still being settled and the domain is relational, which a relational store handles far more gracefully than a key-value design; the load at this scale fits comfortably.

### Protect the launch

- **Build the third-party-AI consent surface and disclosure** into onboarding (Apple 5.1.2(i)).
- **Name a moderation-queue owner with a documented response time at launch** (Apple 1.2). A build team has nobody assigned to live moderation by default.
- **Treat channel-isolation tests as launch-blocking.** A gap here is a privacy breach, not a bug.

## Decisions Needed

Open decisions, grouped by urgency. Each shapes scope, the data model, or launch eligibility.

### Block the build until resolved

| Decision | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Are under-13 users in scope (COPPA)? | Determines consent, age-gating, parental controls, and the moderation posture. Can move the launch by months. Settle before build lock. |
| Is the agentic personalized follow-up in the MLP or post-launch? | Pulling it into the MLP activates the full-build ceiling and a larger team. Lock the scope before the build begins. |
| Channel model: fixed four channels or user-creatable? Multi-channel share? Invite rules? | Drives the data schema and the submit-to-unlock check; must be frozen before submission build begins. |
| Moderation fail policy: fail-open or fail-safe, per content type? | The most consequential runtime behavior in a social app; decide before the channel-read path is built. |

### Resolve early; do not block the build

| Decision | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Claude hosting: Direct API, Bedrock, or Claude Platform on AWS? | Now a privacy and compliance decision as well as a cost one. The one-adapter-plus-seam approach buys time. |
| Operational data store: Aurora Serverless v2 (recommended) or DynamoDB? | Confirm the recommendation. |
| Premium tier at launch or post-launch? | Affects whether the paywall and entitlement model ship in the MLP. Architected as a seam either way. |
| Voice in the MLP: keep, cut, or iOS-only? | Recommendation is to cut or scope to iOS only. |
| MLP scope cuts: event mode out, product-analytics SDK over the warehouse? | Confirm, and resolve the 2,000-concurrent scale-target inconsistency with Scribl. |

---

## Assumptions

Conditions this team model depends on. If any is invalidated before the build begins, revisit the team shape before committing.

> **Team is staffable.** These materials assume the named roles are filled from the Bounteous resource pool and are available across the June-to-September window. Identifying specific individuals is out of scope for this document.

> **AI-enabled team.** All engineers use Claude Code as their primary development tool throughout the engagement. The headcount efficiency of this team model is contingent on this; a team not operating with AI tooling at full adoption cannot deliver on the September 15 timeline at this size.

### Scope

| Assumption | Consequence if wrong |
| --- | --- |
| Personalized agentic follow-up is post-launch, not in MLP scope. | Full-build ceiling activates; the AI/Claude Integration Engineer is required and September 15 is at risk without a scope cut elsewhere. |
| Image composition ("Exciting Artifact") is post-MLP. | Build timeline extends; design and backend surface expand substantially. |
| Voice is cut or scoped to iOS only for the MLP. | If full cross-platform voice is required, an Android transcription path and its variance return to the critical path. |

### Technical

| Assumption | Consequence if wrong |
| --- | --- |
| Aurora Serverless v2 is the operational store. | A different store changes the data layer and the submit-to-unlock implementation. |
| The Skia drawing canvas meets the responsiveness bar on low-end Android. | A native canvas fallback adds build complexity and takes one Mobile Engineer's focus. The week-1 canvas spike de-risks this. |
| Claude hosting is settled early (Direct API as the working default). | A late Bedrock requirement forces feature-parity verification and a privacy/disclosure rework. |

---

## Risks and Questions

What can go wrong, prioritized.

### High risks

**Product loop unvalidated.** The whole fundraise rests on retention from a single universal daily prompt, and on a new user's empty channels not killing the first session. The only current validation gate is the week-13 beta, far too late to change the mechanic. Mitigation: the week-1 clickable prototype test and an explicit cold-start design before build lock.

**App Store and Play review (UGC + AI + social).** This is the highest-scrutiny category, and a two-week buffer does not survive a rejection. Requirements that must be built in, not retrofitted: the third-party-AI consent surface (Apple 5.1.2(i)), a named moderation-queue owner with a documented response time (Apple 1.2), report/block/mute, a published policy, and channel-isolation tests as a launch gate. Submit by September 1.

**COPPA / minors.** A daily-creative consumer app in this category will attract under-13 users whether or not they are "in scope." If minors are in scope, consent flows, age-gating, parental controls, and a heavier moderation posture all land mid-build. This is a gating decision before build lock; it can move the launch by months.

### Other risks

**Cross-platform device fragmentation.** Drawing-canvas behavior on Android vs iOS is a high-probability failure mode. Real-device matrix from week 6, and the week-1 canvas spike on cheap Android, are the mitigations. The second Mobile Engineer gives the canvas dedicated focus and a native-fallback path.

**Engineering Lead overload.** The Engineering Lead owns React Native architecture, the Claude pipeline, and the final code-review call. Schedule the Claude-pipeline upkeep explicitly so it does not decay under delivery pressure.

**Single backend engineer.** One Backend Engineer on a consumer-scale AWS product is lean. Claude Code amplifies the backend and infrastructure work, and DevOps absorbs some infrastructure load; a second Backend Engineer is the next surge add if the streams need it.

**Bedrock requirement from AWS.** If the AWS conversation requires Claude on Bedrock, feature parity must be verified early. The provider abstraction with one hardened adapter keeps this from blocking the build, and it is now also a privacy and compliance consideration.

### Open decisions

Open decisions are tracked in the Decisions Needed section above.
