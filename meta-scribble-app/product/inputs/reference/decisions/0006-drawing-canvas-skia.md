# ADR 0006: Drawing canvas via React Native Skia; voice transcribed on-device

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2026-06-10
**Deciders:** David Lawton, Rob Forshier II
**Related:** [../architecture-plan.md](../architecture-plan.md) §4

## Context

The creative response supports drawing, text, and voice. The drawing canvas is the highest-risk component: canvas behavior diverges between iOS and Android in ways emulators do not surface, and low-end Android is the worst case. Voice adds an AI-surface and privacy question if audio is sent to the cloud.

## Decision

We will implement the drawing canvas with **React Native Skia** (GPU-accelerated, consistent cross-platform, exports to image), and transcribe **voice memos on-device** (`SFSpeechRecognizer` / Android `SpeechRecognizer`), sending only the transcript to moderation. Because Skia avoids per-platform native canvas code, and on-device transcription keeps the Claude surface small, lowers latency, and is a privacy win.

## Alternatives considered

### Option A: Native canvas modules per platform
- Pros: maximum control and performance.
- Cons: two native implementations; needs platform specialists.
- Why not chosen: kept as the fallback if Skia misses the responsiveness bar (triggers a second mobile engineer).

### Option B: Cloud speech-to-text (Claude or a transcription API)
- Pros: potentially higher accuracy.
- Cons: sends audio off-device; adds latency, cost, and privacy/consent scope.
- Why not chosen: on-device meets the need and keeps the AI surface lean.

## Consequences

### Positive
- One canvas codebase; small AI surface; audio stays on-device unless shared.

### Negative
- Skia is a heavyweight native dependency; bridging quirks possible.

### Risks to monitor
- Skia responsiveness on low-end Android (real-device testing from week 6). Trigger: native-canvas fallback + second mobile engineer.
