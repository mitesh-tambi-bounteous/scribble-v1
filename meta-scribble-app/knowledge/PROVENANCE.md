# Knowledge ingest provenance -- Scribl

Audit trail for material ingested into `knowledge/` from the Scribl engagement
source material.

- **Source (all entries):** the scribl engagement's project inputs, relocated
  verbatim under `product/inputs/`.
- **Date ingested:** 2026-06-30.
- **Why trusted:** the engagement source-of-record deliverables for the Scribl D2C
  build.

## research/

| Ingested note | From source artifact |
| --- | --- |
| `research/scribl-client-summary.md` | `reference/client-summary.md` |
| `research/scribl-engagement-approach.md` | `reference/engagement-approach.md` |
| `research/scribl-technical-implementation-plan.md` | `reference/technical-implementation-plan.md` |
| `research/scribl-team-model.md` | `reference/scribl-team-model.md` |
| `research/scribl-poc-aws-architecture.md` | `reference/poc/architecture/README.md` and `cost-model.md` |

## meetings/

| Ingested digest | From source artifact |
| --- | --- |
| `meetings/scribl-approach-discussion.md` | `reference/discussions/scribl-approach-digest.md` and the `scribl-approach.vtt` transcript |

The meeting digest carries a "Suggested action items" section. A human promotes
those to `tracking/stories/`; they are not auto-created.

## design-history/

- **Date ingested:** 2026-07-02.
- **Why trusted:** design artifacts cherry-picked into this branch to document the
  visual evolution of the Scribl D2C app for the living wiki.

| Ingested page | From source artifact |
| --- | --- |
| `product/context/design-history/original-wireframes.md` | `product/inputs/scribl-d2c-flow.png` (original D2C user-flow wireframe supplied by Scribl) |
| `product/context/design-history/latest-designs.md` | a staged design export (self-contained bundler HTML covering Home, Log in, Create account, Family/Public wall, Prompt of the day, Draw/Studio, Your streak, and Your walls screens) |

The original full-app UI mockup (`product/inputs/scribl-d2c-ui-mockup.html`, Claude
Design export) is preserved as a served bundle and linked from the Input
Artifacts hub rather than rendered as its own design-history page.

## Not ingested (preserved as source only)

The ADRs (`reference/decisions/0001-0011`), the discussion topics, the source repo
readme, the POC build-approach HTML, the POC project-dna harness files, and the
binary artifacts (png, pdf, docx, xlsx) are preserved verbatim under `product/inputs/`
and were not transformed into knowledge notes. The binary architecture diagram and
cost workbook remain the canonical sources behind the ingested architecture note.
