# Scribl x Bounteous Kickoff Workshop -- Retro (2026-07-14)

Durable retro of the 2026-07-14 Scribl x Bounteous kickoff workshop. This is a
deliberate exception to the "transcripts are operational records, not wiki
knowledge" default: a workshop retro is durable knowledge. The operational
digest and the action-item seam live at
[`knowledge/meetings/2026-07-14-workshop.md`](../../meetings/2026-07-14-workshop.md);
the raw transcript is preserved internally at
`knowledge/meetings/raw/2026-07-14-workshop.md` (not in the rendered site).

**Format:** Microsoft Teams, ~3h44m, live LucidSpark board, two live prototype
demos. Facilitators: Angie Yap (MC), David Lawton (working sessions), Rob
Forshier II (demos). Executive sponsor: Marty Young.

| Side | People |
| --- | --- |
| Scribl | Matt Kaplan (CEO), Jeff Sparr (CRO, co-founder), Eric Rice (CCO / game design), Helen Leffers (Chief of Staff), Abbie Knapton (Customer Experience Lead) |
| Bounteous | Angie Yap (Alliances, MC), David Lawton (Sr. Principal, AI Methodology & Delivery), Marty Young (EVP Data & AI, sponsor), Rob Forshier II (AI Architect), John Kilgore (Client Service, relationship + MSA lead) |

## How the workshop went

The workshop achieved its goal: the room committed to a path into Phase 0 and
mapped the launch scope. It also reset one major assumption. The PRFAQ's August 1
submission and September 15 launch dates came off the table. Matt Kaplan called
them "very fictitious," and the room re-anchored the whole plan on the **AWS
re:Invent keynote (~December 5, 2026)** as the aspirational proof point, with
every other date driven by product readiness once Scribl syncs internally.

Everything else landed cleanly. All eight key feature decisions were made, mostly
matching the pre-read recommendations. The prototype earned strong buy-in ("I
would be out pitching this tomorrow with what you showed us today," Matt Kaplan).
Both founders closed with clear commitment ("We've been waiting 20 years for this.
Let's go," Jeff Sparr).

The session doubled as a live proof of the Bounteous shape-phase methodology:
Rob demoed a working Expo prototype (not wireframes) built from Scribl's inputs,
then a second time grew it live during the session at Marty's request for "a
little extra wow factor" -- adding draw-your-own avatars, more brushes and colors,
an archives "yesterday" view, and removing comments on the spot. David also
demoed the project "brain" (this repo: a VitePress wiki plus a knowledge base the
delivery team works out of).

## Key learnings and shifts to carry forward

1. **Timeline is now re:Invent-anchored and readiness-driven.** Beta, public
   launch, and first-submission dates are TBD pending Scribl's internal sync.
   This relaxes the 9-week compression pressure that drove several pre-read
   recommendations.
2. **Claude ambition rose above the conservative baseline.** The room wants Claude
   visibly central from beta -- both as a user differentiator and as an
   Anthropic-funding magnet. Ideas: personalized, context-aware prompts (Eric's
   "what was your favorite ride at Epcot?" example) and a psychology-informed
   empathy agent (Marty, Eric). The specific Sonnet / Haiku / Opus mapping was
   never named in the room; it stayed at the "Claude" level.
3. **The prototype is the production seed.** Rob's Expo app plus the brain repo is
   the starting point the team finishes, not a throwaway POC.
4. **Simplicity is the essence, connection is the bet.** "This is not a drawing
   platform. This is a connection platform" (Matt). The room repeatedly resisted
   feature complexity (fill bucket, extra brushes) as a threat to the level
   playing field.
5. **Fundraising is immediate and continuous.** Matt would pitch "tomorrow."
   Marty floated a reframe: an MLP built primarily to sharpen the pitch, which may
   reach public release later.
6. **Enterprise event mode pulled forward** to be solutioned for re:Invent,
   reframed as wall capacity for organizations (~100k concurrent submissions).
   Eric flagged a past game degraded around 50 to 60 participants, so scale is a
   real risk.
7. **Mission Cloud is a live third party.** Mission built the AI-enhancement
   pipeline (PDF delivered the prior Friday). Rob rebuilt it in-app using
   per-stroke data, removing the OCR step Mission needed. The Bounteous / Mission
   Cloud vendor boundary stayed open -- an ownership question to resolve. Related
   ask: flavor AI output with Scribl's own style ("scribbly clouds," not a
   Renaissance field); Scribl will supply reference art.
8. **Analytics accessibility is a hard requirement.** Scribl struggles to parse
   its own data today (Metabase). Eric called it "the bane of my existence."
   Accessible reporting for Scribl staff must be usable at launch.

### North Star

**Status: direction locked, final wording pending.** The bet is **connection**,
and **simplicity** must appear in the statement (Jeff: "without that word simple,
it's missing the essence"). The team left with a mandate to finish the wording
with Helen. The three finalists the room voted up:

| Type | Statement | Votes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| We win when | "We win when users connect with the people in their lives who matter most." | 3 (top) |
| Billboard | "Draw something simple. Discover something real." | 3 (top) |
| Product is | "Scribl empowers you to connect authentically with those that matter most across distance, schedules, and generations." | 2 |

Matt favored centering the individual: an empowering personal experience is the
fuel for adoption and virality.

## Decisions made

All eight decision cards were filled and confirmed verbally. Owner is the person
who made or ratified the call.

| # | Decision | The call | Owner | Rationale | Vs. pre-read |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Voice memo response | Fast-follow after MLP. Typed story text stays in for both platforms. | Matt | Typing suffices for MLP speed; Android audio storage is heavy; dictation is a nice-to-have. | Matches |
| 2 | Paywall timing | Post-launch. | Matt | Beta gathers maximum data; run-cost and artifact-cost unknown, so pricing waits. | Matches |
| 3 | Personalized follow-ups | Post-MLP for real personalization. Scaffold from the start; use generic and event-based pushes in the interim. | Eric, Rob, Marty | Build the plumbing early, activate per user once data accrues. | Matches (seam) |
| 4 | Age gate / minors (COPPA) | Ship 13+ first for beta and public launch. Under-13 as a separate submission after launch, with in-app "coming soon" for minors. | Marty | Apple minor-protection + COPPA add a month-plus and heavy reporting; deferral protects the re:Invent window. | Matches, with a flag (below) |
| 5 | Moderation fail policy | Fail-safe: hold submissions if moderation is down. Richer degradation UX post-MLP. | Matt (to Bounteous's lead) | "If we're gonna fail, let's be safe." Outages rare; beta users tolerate rough edges. | Matches |
| 6 | Claude integration depth | Claude is a beta-visible differentiator: personalized/context-aware prompts, drawing reflection, empathy agent. Exciting Artifact stays a seam. | David, Marty | Meaningful Claude presence delights users and strengthens the Anthropic funding case. | Deviation: more ambitious than baseline |
| 7 | Partner API "at launch" claim | Post-MLP. Scribl amends the PRFAQ. | Matt | The PRFAQ is a working draft; the API has no build stream today. | Matches intent |
| 8 | Channel model | A fixed set of predefined, renamable channels for MLP, tagged by wall type (family / friends / coworkers). Unlimited channels behind the paywall. | David, Matt | Predefined keeps measurement consistent; instinct converged near three to four. | Partial: exact number open |

Two further settled items:

- **Claude hosting: confirmed on Amazon Bedrock**, settled outside the workshop
  and tied to the AWS funding arrangement. The board's AWS architecture diagram
  already routes Claude through Bedrock. The provider abstraction stays in the
  design to keep the adapter swappable.
- **Comments are removed from the product.** The room's aversion to social-media
  negativity became a product principle; Rob deleted comments live in the pivot
  demo. Marty logged a future idea: reactions expressed as drawings or emoji
  rather than text. Eric's Bob Ross "Happy Little Accidents" inspiration -- respond
  by drawing on top of someone's piece -- reinforced that the whole language of the
  game should be drawing, not speech.

### Feature placement (where the room put each feature)

- **Beta (proves the habit loop):** core canvas, fill bucket, brush sizes, color
  palette; typed story text (both platforms); AI background enhancement with an
  on/off settings toggle; daily prompt + challenges; streaks/milestones/badges;
  archives/timeline; draw-your-own avatars; fixed channels (number TBD) with
  wall-type tags; submit-to-unlock; content moderation (fail-safe); meaningful
  Claude features; compliance gates (13+, UGC report, block/mute, privacy labels);
  accessible analytics for Scribl staff.
- **By launch (polish + store readiness):** social sharing (Wordle-style image +
  a "wrapped" link to a static "coming soon" site); export/printables; custom
  channel names; organizing reusable custom prompts; notification prefs/quiet
  hours; store listings; channel-isolation + load tests as a launch gate;
  AI-consent surface, in-app deletion, AI-content labels, ToS, support contact.
- **Post-launch:** voice memo + Android dictation; premium paywall; under-13
  experience (separate submission); partner API; unlimited archives (paywall);
  theme packs / custom props; unlockables + progression rewards (Eric's vision);
  sticker store; the Exciting Artifact (shareable family collage, held as a seam);
  Slack/Teams, SSO, enterprise admin, localization, SOC 2.

Items that moved during the session: voice memo (demo -> post-MLP fast-follow);
social sharing (beta -> by launch); enterprise event mode / high-capacity walls
(post-launch -> solution now, plan for re:Invent); comments (demo -> removed);
notification prefs (unscoped -> by launch).

## Future and open decisions (need Rob's ratification, not just recording)

These surfaced as directional but not settled; several carry a flag:

- **Age gate deferral is reluctant.** All three Scribl leaders named the 8 to 12
  family sweet spot as the ideal target; they defer under-13 only because Apple
  and COPPA threaten the re:Invent timeline. **David to research** whether Apple's
  parental-approval ("ask-to-buy") flow could mitigate the under-13 requirement,
  and current rejection stringency.
- **Final North Star wording** (connection locked; fold in "simple"; finish with
  Helen).
- **Exact number of fixed channels** (three vs four; whether coworkers is its own).
- **Pricing model** and what sits in front of vs behind the paywall (blocked on
  run-cost and artifact-cost).
- **Free-tier archive cap** and whether it couples to the paywall (David's
  instinct: independent).
- **Per-wall capacity limits** and enterprise / re:Invent scale.
- **Exciting Artifact scope**, and whether any version belongs earlier than a
  post-launch seam.
- **All launch dates** (beta, public, first submission), pending Scribl's internal
  sync.
- **Bounteous / Mission Cloud vendor boundary** on the AI-enhancement pipeline.
- **AI-generated daily prompts** (PRFAQ) vs a curated preset list.
- **Angel pitch cadence** (continuous rather than a single window; Matt pitching
  immediately).

### Risks raised

| Risk | Impact | Raised by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Apple social + minor-protection review (April 2026 COPPA update) | Month-plus review delay, heavy reporting, higher rejection odds | David |
| Store rejection eating the launch buffer | Slips public launch past re:Invent | David |
| Android device fragmentation | Voice/speech may fail on older hand-me-down devices in family beta groups | David |
| Scribl data / analytics inadequacy | Scribl cannot parse its own usage today | Eric, Abbie |
| Cost uncertainty (run-cost, artifact-cost) | Blocks the pricing model | Matt |
| Wall overcrowding / crash at scale | Enterprise and re:Invent scale unproven | Eric |
| Q4 vacation-season staffing | Sprint velocity risk (Eric reframed October launch as a family-connection opportunity) | David, Eric |

## Next steps

The commercial path the room agreed to: Bounteous synthesizes the readout, then
delivers a proposal with pricing. John Kilgore starts the MSA now so Scribl legal
has runway. Bounteous applies for AWS funding on Scribl's behalf and coordinates a
three-way alignment call; Marty carries the Anthropic funding case. Dates get
stamped after Scribl's internal sync.

Full owner/timing action-item table lives in the meeting digest
([`knowledge/meetings/2026-07-14-workshop.md`](../../meetings/2026-07-14-workshop.md),
"Suggested action items"). Headline items:

- Synthesize the workshop into a readout PDF, then a proposal + pricing (Angie / Bounteous).
- Kick off the MSA now for Scribl legal to redline (John Kilgore, long-pole).
- Apply for AWS funding on Scribl's behalf; set up a three-way AWS + Scribl +
  Bounteous alignment call (Angie); pursue Anthropic funding (Marty).
- Work backward from re:Invent on stage/submission requirements; Helen lobbies
  early for a slot (Angie, Marty).
- Build accessible analytics/reporting for Scribl staff (Bounteous, by launch).
- Solution wall capacity for re:Invent ~100k concurrent (Bounteous).
- Amend the PRFAQ; supply Scribl-branded reference art for AI tuning (Scribl).

### Board close-out gaps to chase

The LucidSpark board left several convergent fields open by design; this retro is
the durable record until they are stamped: the final agreed North Star sentence;
RACI letters in the Key Stakeholders matrix; owners on the Risks Log; owners and
dates on the Phase 0 Commit next-action rows.
