# S-013 -- Record response (30-sec audio)

The record-response screen is the second response modality reached from the Draw
canvas: a short 30-second audio response over the drawing. Web audio capture is
now wired via real `MediaRecorder`/`getUserMedia`; native (iOS/Android) capture
is still a stub that throws. Recorded audio is not yet wired into the submit flow.

**Status note** (commit `90409d0`, #13): `src/services/audioRecorder.ts` has a
working web implementation (`tests/audioRecorder.web.test.ts` covers it), but
`audioRecorder.native.ts` is a stub throwing "Native audio capture deferred to
iOS/Android bring-up." Recording/upload integration to submit/backend is
explicitly out of scope per code comment. Web/device parity therefore not met.

## AC

- [x] The screen provides a mic affordance and a named "Share" button that
  navigates to Home (S-014).
- [x] Real audio capture is wired on web via `MediaRecorder`/`getUserMedia` in
  `src/services/audioRecorder.ts`, tested in `audioRecorder.web.test.ts`.
- [ ] Native (iOS/Android) audio capture -- OPEN. `audioRecorder.native.ts` is
  a stub that throws; no expo-av or audio library dependency yet.
- [ ] Recorded audio is not yet wired into the submit/backend flow -- explicitly
  out of scope per code comment, OPEN.
- [ ] Web/device parity AC not met until native capture is implemented.
- [x] The screen is reachable from the Draw canvas (`app/draw.tsx`) Record
  action with working navigation.
- [x] The screen renders on web; on-device behavior blocked by native stub.
