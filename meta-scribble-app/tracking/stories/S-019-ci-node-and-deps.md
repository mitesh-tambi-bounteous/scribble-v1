# S-019 -- CI Node 22 and safe dependency bumps

This is infra work, not a screen, and it is folded into the first build worker.
It bumps CI to Node 22 to clear the engine warning and applies the safe direct
dependency updates while explicitly deferring the risky transitive ones. It
carries no nav or fidelity acceptance criteria.

## AC

- [ ] CI Node is bumped to 22 so the EBADENGINE warning is gone.
- [ ] Safely-bumpable direct dependencies are updated.
- [ ] The transitive jest/jsdom deprecations (glob@7, inflight, abab,
  domexception, whatwg-encoding) are explicitly DEFERRED as tooling-dragged, low
  value, and high risk, and the deferral is logged with reasons.
- [ ] The app still builds and the existing daily-loop tests pass on web and on
  device after the bump.
- [ ] This story is infra, not a screen: it carries no nav or fidelity items.
