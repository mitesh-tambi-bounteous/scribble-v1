# S-016 -- Family wall grid (empty and filled)

The family wall grid is a hero screen: the shared wall of responses. It must
handle both the first-session empty state and a filled grid of response
thumbnails, and it supersedes and upgrades the basic `app/wall.tsx`.

## AC

- [ ] The screen renders an empty-state grid for the first session with no
  responses.
- [ ] The screen renders a filled grid of response thumbnails.
- [ ] A bottom nav bar with home / inbox / sparkle affordances is present.
- [ ] A settings affordance and a download affordance are present per the flow.
- [ ] Tapping a grid cell navigates to the Response detail (S-017).
- [ ] This screen supersedes/upgrades `app/wall.tsx`.
- [ ] This is a hero screen: the fidelity pass delivers a colorful filled grid
  matching the flow, with highlighted cells.
- [ ] The screen ships first as a skeleton with working navigation, then the
  hero fidelity follows in a later pass.
- [ ] The screen renders and behaves identically on the web export and on an
  iOS/Android device or simulator from the single Expo/React Native codebase.
