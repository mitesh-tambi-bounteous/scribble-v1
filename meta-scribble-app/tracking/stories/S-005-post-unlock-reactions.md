# S-005 -- Post-unlock reactions

After unlocking the wall (S-003), the user can react to other responses.
Reactions are only available post-unlock.

**Shipped** in commit `58d8ab5` (#9): `app/wall.tsx` renders reaction emoji
buttons (`REACTION_EMOJIS`) gated behind `locked === false` via `useWallStore.react()`.
Wall and store tests cover the flow; note that gating is not covered by a
dedicated invariant test the way S-003/004 are.

## AC

- [x] Reaction controls are not available/active before submit-to-unlock.
- [x] After unlock, the user can add a reaction to another user's response on the
  channel wall.
- [x] A reaction persists through the thin data client and is reflected on the
  response when the wall reloads.
- [x] Reactions render consistently on web and on device.
