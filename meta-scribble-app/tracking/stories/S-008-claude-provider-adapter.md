# S-008 -- Claude provider adapter

Inference (drawing caption/vision-read, moderation, daily prompt generation) sits
behind a provider abstraction over the Claude Messages API shape. The POC defaults
to the Direct Anthropic API; the same adapter targets Bedrock-fronted Claude as a
config choice, so the hosting decision does not block the build.

## AC

- [x] All model calls go through a single provider adapter, not direct SDK calls
  scattered in feature code.
- [x] The adapter exposes a Messages-API-shaped interface so Direct Anthropic and
  Bedrock-fronted Claude are interchangeable by config.
- [x] The provider (Direct Anthropic vs Bedrock) is selected by configuration with
  no change to call sites.
- [x] For the POC, the adapter can run against mock/seeded responses so the loop is
  demoable without live inference.

Closeout note (2026-07-27 review): story was moved to Done when the work
merged to MobileApp main; AC boxes ticked retroactively per the board record.
