# S-022 -- Invite-by-email channel membership

Let a family (group channel) member invite someone by email so they become a
member of the channel. Previously the create-wall screen captured an invite
email but dropped it (no endpoint existed).

Stub for tracking. Implemented (pending review) in rforsh/MobileApp PR #23
(branch `scribl-devx-userwalk`).

## AC

- [ ] `POST /channels/:id/members` adds a member by email; the caller must
  already be a member of the channel (403 not_a_member otherwise), enforced
  server-side from the caller identity.
- [ ] The invitee is resolved-or-created by email (idempotent) and granted
  membership; a returning invitee is not duplicated.
- [ ] The create-wall screen sends the captured invite email after the channel
  is created; failures surface inline without blocking navigation.
- [ ] Channel-isolation (S-004) invariants are unaffected: membership is the
  only thing granted, and reads remain gated server-side.

## Notes

Relates to family walls (S-016). Consumed by family challenges (S-020), whose
participants are the channel's members.
