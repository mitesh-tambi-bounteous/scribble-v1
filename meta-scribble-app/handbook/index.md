# scribl Handbook

The living process wiki for scribl. It is seeded at mint as a minimal
starter and grows into this repo's real process documentation over the
engagement. Add to it as decisions are made and habits form.

Authoring lives here in `handbook/`. The doc site pages are generated:
run `npm run docs:sync` to render this handbook into `docs/`. Never hand-edit
the generated pages under `docs/`, edit the source here and re-sync.

## Contents

- [Definition of Ready](definition-of-ready.md) -- when a work item is ready to start.
- [Definition of Done](definition-of-done.md) -- when a work item is truly finished.
- [Ways of Working with the Client](client-facing-ways-of-working.md) -- standup rules, escalation path, and how we hold the line on the stack.
- [Team Process](team-process.md) -- how work flows, how PRs and decisions are handled.
- [Ceremonies](ceremonies.md) -- standup, refinement, planning, review, retro.
- [Roles and Responsibilities](roles-and-raci.md) -- who does what, plus a RACI table.
- [Estimation and Forecasting](estimation.md) -- story points, velocity, forecasting.
- [Backlog and Workflow](backlog-and-workflow.md) -- how work flows across the board.

- [Release Management](release-management.md) -- scheduled releases and exceptions.
- [Story/AC Kit](story-ac-kit/index.md) -- the installed story and
  acceptance-criteria kit: what to run, in what order, and how the team
  writes to Jira while keeping the repo in step.
- [Engineering Practice](engineering/index.md) -- how the production app is
  built: the decision register, and where the architecture, standards and
  toolchain documents live.

## Not carried over

This handbook is a curated distillation of the Bounteous Agile Delivery
Confluence space, not a full copy. The following were deliberately skipped:

- **The Archive subtree** (id 264465790665641 and descendants) -- old 2018-2019
  material, superseded.
- **Draft, empty, and "Copy of ..." pages** -- work in progress, not
  authoritative.
- **Scrum Knowledge Questions** (id 264466433933660) and **Did You Know?**
  (id 264465980198225) -- quiz and trivia, not process reference.
- **The deep Kanban subtree** (id 264465938645180 and children) -- this team
  runs a Now / Next / Blocked / Done board; the workflow is folded into
  [Backlog and Workflow](backlog-and-workflow.md) as a one-paragraph pointer and
  the rest is skipped.
- **Ensemble / Mob Programming** (id 264466120638482) -- not this team's
  operating model.
- **External Miro retro boards** -- linked out from [Ceremonies](ceremonies.md)
  rather than recreated.
