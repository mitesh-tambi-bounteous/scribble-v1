# Review: iOS distribution doc + buildable iOS side

## What went well

- The Android worker's iOS notes in the brief were accurate: the path is
  symmetric once tooling is present. No rediscovery needed.
- Parallelizing paid off: submodule init, CocoaPods install, and the doc draft
  all ran at once, so the toolchain was ready by the time the doc was reviewed.
- The build prep went further than the brief assumed. The brief expected "no
  Xcode" as the hard blocker, but Xcode.app was already installed; the real
  blocker narrowed to the privileged `xcode-select` switch. prebuild and
  `pod install` (103 pods) both ran clean, so the project is one sudo command
  away from a Simulator build.

## What took too long / friction

- The doc draft initially recommended EAS Build/Submit as the easy path, which
  directly violates the app's golden rule (vendor/mobileapp/CLAUDE.md: no EAS,
  builds in AWS). Caught and corrected on review. The subagent that wrote the
  doc did not have the submodule CLAUDE.md in context.
- `docs:build` needs the meta repo's node_modules, which were not installed in a
  fresh worktree. `docs:sync` only needs node built-ins, so sync succeeded but
  the first build-verify failed with "vitepress: command not found" until
  `npm install` ran.

## What to change in the playbook

- When dispatching a subagent to write build/release guidance, pass the code
  repo's CLAUDE.md golden rules (especially OSS-only / no-EAS) in the prompt.
  Build-tooling recommendations are exactly where a generic agent drifts.
- A brief that assumes a blocker ("no Xcode") should still be verified first.
  The environment had moved on since the note was written.
- Consider a worktree bootstrap step that runs `npm install` in the meta repo so
  `docs:build` verification works without a separate install.

## Update: build verified end to end (same day)

After Rob activated Xcode (the sudo commands), the build was driven to a working
Simulator launch. Two reusable learnings worth keeping in the playbook:

- Xcode 26 ships the iOS SDK but NO bootable simulator runtime. A fresh Xcode has
  zero simulator devices, so `expo run:ios` fails with "No iOS devices available
  in Simulator.app" -- which reads like a project error but is a missing-runtime
  error. Fix: `xcodebuild -downloadPlatform iOS` (about 8.5 GB, no admin). Add
  this to any iOS build runbook; it is not obvious from the expo error.
- A stale `DEVELOPER_DIR` env var in the automation shell overrode the
  system-wide `xcode-select` setting, so tools saw CommandLineTools even after
  Rob's sudo switch succeeded. Diagnose activation via
  `readlink /var/db/xcode_select_link` (system truth) vs `echo $DEVELOPER_DIR`
  (shell override), not `xcode-select -p` alone.

Also: the Android output had no wiki page despite the APK build being done. Added
docs/android-distribution.md alongside the iOS page so both generated native
outputs are documented adjacent to each other.

## Inventory

- docs/ios-distribution.md (source s2d/ios-distribution.md): VERIFIED build status.
- docs/android-distribution.md (source s2d/android-distribution.md): NEW Android
  APK output/distribution page. Both synced + in the sidebar.
- vendor/mobileapp: ios/ + android/ generated (gitignored CNG); app.json
  ios.bundleIdentifier committed on app-repo branch `scribl-ios-bundle-id`
  (PR open, pin NOT bumped until merge).
- iOS build proven on iPhone 17 Simulator (iOS 26.5, Xcode 26.6).
