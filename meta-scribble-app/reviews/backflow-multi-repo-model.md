# Back-flow: multi-repo roled model

## Problem

Today a brain drives a single code repo. `project.json` carries one
`code_repo: "rforsh/MobileApp"`. Real engagements span multiple repos at once --
mobile, backend, ai, db, and infra -- and the single-repo assumption forces all
of that into one pointer or leaves the other repos untracked by the brain.

## Proposed change

Replace the single `code_repo` string with a `repos` array of roled entries.
Keep `brain_repo` and `engine` as-is.

Before:

```json
{
  "code_repo": "rforsh/MobileApp"
}
```

After:

```json
{
  "repos": [
    { "name": "rforsh/MobileApp", "role": "mobile" },
    { "name": "...", "role": "backend" }
  ]
}
```

Roles are drawn from the set: mobile | backend | ai | db | infra.

## Command changes

- The `/project-*` commands gain a repo/role target argument so that build and
  verify work targets the right repo's worktrees.
- Stories and briefs tag their repo: a `repo:` or `role:` field in story
  frontmatter, so each work item names where its code lives.

## Migration / back-compat

- A single-repo `code_repo` string can be read as a one-element `repos` array,
  so existing brains keep working without edits. New brains use `repos[]`
  directly.

## Scope note

This is a proposal for operator review. Do NOT edit the methodology engine in
this increment. When approved, the change is made in the methodology engine and
shipped as a back-flow PR upstream; it is the first such PR (see the design
spec S5/S6).
