# Work order: what the Arc.Loom generator should bake into future meta-repos

The generator that minted this repo is explicitly NOT touched in this
engagement; the upgrade will likely land after the generator moves into
HarnessBuilder. Every item below was observed in this repo and is framed as
"what the generator should bake into future meta-repos". Evidence cites this
repo's files. Companion assessment:
[reviews/2026-07-27-knowledge-format-assessment.md](2026-07-27-knowledge-format-assessment.md).

## 1. Process defaults

- **Bake definition-of-done and definition-of-ready into the generated
  handbook, enforced by the story template.** The handbook here has both, but
  generated stories shipped without an `updated:` field and Done stories in
  tracking/stories/ accumulated unchecked AC. The story-sync mandate the
  generator emits (see CLAUDE.md) should make AC-closeout part of moving a
  story to Done.
- **Story frontmatter should include `updated:`.** Without it, staleness of a
  story page is undetectable mechanically.
- **Board columns should define "pending review" distinctly from "blocked".**
  tracking/board.md has Now / Next / Blocked / Done; work awaiting human review
  has no honest home and gets misfiled.

## 2. Knowledge / OKF

- **Mint knowledge bases OKF-conformant at authoring time, or ship an export
  transform.** Concretely: `type:` on every non-reserved .md (research/ notes
  here had none), `title:`/`description:` recommended keys, markdown links not
  wikilinks, log.md newest-first. This repo needed all four fixed by hand.
- **Ship index drift tooling as npm scripts.** check-index / update-index:
  .claude/agents/wiki-linter.md and wiki-ingestor.md reference make targets
  that do not exist in this repo. npm scripts fit the generated toolchain.
- **Decide the provenance model.** OKF v0.2 per-page trust/provenance
  frontmatter (generated / verified / sources / status / stale_after) vs the
  central knowledge/PROVENANCE.md this repo carries. One schema decision, made
  once, at the generator level.
- **Make the page-type registry an explicit generator parameter.** This repo
  silently drops the brain's comparison and notes types; fine, but the trim
  should be declared so /query and lint expectations stay consistent.

## 3. Pipeline hardening (observed failure modes here)

- **docs-sync syncTree never deletes orphaned destination files.** Hand-edits
  inside docs/ survived invisibly across syncs. Add prune-or-warn on
  destination files with no source.
- **applyRule silently skips missing sources.** A renamed source file silently
  freezes its rendered page forever. Warn loudly or fail.
- **normalize-prose replacements must be whitespace-aware and idempotent.**
  Re-running the transform must be a no-op, including across line wraps.
- **Generated trees need a marker convention.** Nothing distinguishes
  generated-vs-hand-maintained subtrees under docs/; the design-history
  incident happened because a hand-maintained page lived inside a generated
  tree.
- **Derive repo-identity fields from git remotes at generation time.**
  project.json code_repo/brain_repo and the clone URLs in CLAUDE.md and README
  were typed by hand: this repo shipped with a GitHub URL and a typo for a
  Bitbucket-hosted repo.

## 4. Reviews / flywheel

- **Wire reviews/ into the doc site by default.** The flywheel is a baked-in
  habit (CLAUDE.md), but docs-sync renders only s2d/ and tracking/, so reviews
  are invisible in the rendered wiki.
- **Emit mechanically checkable prose-lint rules.** The "do not name the
  legacy consulting firm" rule here is unenforceable as written: it does not
  say which name to grep for. Every rule the generator emits should come with
  its check.

Not in scope here: no generator changes were made in this engagement; this
note is the ready-to-lift work order for when the generator upgrade happens.
