# reviews/

The self-improvement record. Two kinds of artifact live here: per-stage reviews
(written continuously as work happens) and the final postmortem (written when
the work ships). These feed the learning flywheel: the strongest findings are
published back to the methodology engine so the playbook improves from every
engagement.

This is a baked-in habit, not an optional extra. The `/project-*` stage commands
prompt for an end-of-stage review by default; write one even when working by
hand.

## Per-stage review shape

One file per stage or task boundary, named by stage and date (for example
`P4-architecture-2026-06-30.md`). Keep it short and honest.

```markdown
---
stage: P4 architecture
date: 2026-06-30
---

# Review: P4 architecture

## What went well

-

## What took too long

-

## What to change in the playbook

- (if this is methodology friction, edit the methodology engine and flag a back-flow PR)

## Learnings captured

- (link to patterns/ entries created from this stage)
```

## Final postmortem shape

Written once, when the POC ships and the delivery team rolls on. Named
`postmortem-scribl.md`.

```markdown
---
project: scribl
type: mobile-app-poc
date:
outcome:
---

# Postmortem: scribl

## Inventory

- What was built, stages run, and key decisions.

## Durations

- Stage-by-stage time, where it went.

## Friction

- What slowed us down; what to change in the playbook.

## Wins

- What worked and should be repeated.

## Published learnings

- The compact record and reviews pushed back to the methodology engine's learnings corpus.
