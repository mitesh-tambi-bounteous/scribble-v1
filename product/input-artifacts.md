# Input artifacts

The verbatim engagement source material that scribl started from, preserved
under `product/inputs/` and rendered here as browsable pages. This is the curated
hub: the originals as the client and the team produced them, before any build
work. For the narrative that ties them together, see [The Story](/story).

## Product and requirements

- [MVP scope / BRD](/context/documents/scribl-d2c-mvp-scope) -- the business
  requirements and the D2C MVP scope.
- [D2C MLP PRFAQ](/context/documents/scribl-d2c-mlp-prfaq) -- the press-release /
  FAQ framing of the product vision.

## Design

- [D2C user-flow wireframe](/context/media/scribl-d2c-flow) -- the end-to-end
  flow. Original image: [scribl-d2c-flow.png](/assets/context/scribl-d2c-flow.png).
- [Original UI mockup](/assets/context/scribl-d2c-ui-mockup.html) -- the early
  design direction, as a self-contained HTML bundle.
- [Latest designs](/context/design-history/latest-designs) -- the current design
  direction across the hero screens. Original bundle:
  [scribl-latest-designs.html](/assets/context/scribl-latest-designs.html).

## Architecture and cost

- [AWS architecture diagram](/context/media/scribl-aws-architecture-d2c) -- the
  production target topology. Original image:
  [scribl-aws-architecture-d2c.png](/assets/context/scribl-aws-architecture-d2c.png).
- [Cost model](/context/pages/reference/poc/architecture/cost-model) -- the cost
  narrative for the architecture, including the detailed line-item estimate.
- Mission Cloud POC handover -- the vendor's AI artifact-generation
  proof-of-concept handover (Mission Cloud Services, June 2026), the research
  basis for the enhancement pipeline; internal, not on the rendered site.

### AI-enhancement pipelines

- [Mission Cloud enhancement pipeline](/context/pages/reference/poc/architecture/mission-cloud-enhancement-pipeline)
  -- the vendor's proposed 6-stage Bedrock pipeline, extracted from the handover.
- [Our enhancement pipeline](/context/pages/reference/poc/architecture/our-enhancement-pipeline)
  -- what we actually shipped on MobileApp, as a comparison to the vendor's.

## Engagement context

- [Client summary](/context/pages/reference/client-summary) -- who the client is
  and what they asked for.
- [Engagement approach](/context/pages/reference/engagement-approach) -- how the
  work was framed and run.
- Team model -- the delivery team shape; internal, not on the rendered site.
- [Discussion topics](/context/pages/reference/discussion-topics) -- the open
  questions carried into the engagement.

## Engagement contract

- Executed SOW: Mobile App Development -- the signed Statement of Work
  (effective 2026-08-13, Docusign Envelope ID
  9A10DEA4-2C98-8275-8320-AFEE81F05ABA), preserved verbatim as
  `product/inputs/scribl-bounteous-sow-mobile-app-development.pdf` (binary, not
  rendered on the doc site).

## Decisions

- [Decision record index](/context/pages/reference/decisions/README) -- the ADRs
  ratifying the load-bearing technical choices (React Native primary, serverless
  backend, DynamoDB single-table, Claude provider abstraction, model tiering, and
  the rest).
