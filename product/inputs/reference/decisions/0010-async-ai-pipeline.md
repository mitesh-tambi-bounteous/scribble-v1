# ADR 0010: Drawing interpretation and moderation run async; submit never blocks on AI

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2026-06-10
**Deciders:** David Lawton, Rob Forshier II
**Related:** [../architecture-plan.md](../architecture-plan.md) §7, §11

## Context

Two product principles are in tension with AI latency: submit-to-unlock must feel instant, and Claude must degrade gracefully. The drawing-interpretation reflection is an enhancement, not a gate; moderation must protect channels but cannot make submit feel slow.

## Decision

We will run drawing interpretation (and moderation-as-enhancement) **asynchronously off an SQS queue**: the user submits and unlocks immediately, and the Claude reflection arrives shortly after as a non-blocking update. Because it keeps AI off the critical path, lets the core loop survive an AI outage, and lets us sample or throttle AI work under cost pressure without breaking the experience.

## Alternatives considered

### Option A: Synchronous AI on submit
- Pros: reflection appears with the submission.
- Cons: couples unlock latency to Claude; an AI outage blocks the core loop.
- Why not chosen: violates instant-unlock and graceful-degradation.

### Option B: No AI reflection (moderation only)
- Pros: simplest.
- Cons: drops the genuine Claude differentiator (drawing interpretation).
- Why not chosen: the reflection is the most compelling product-side Claude feature.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Submit is instant; core loop is resilient; AI cost is throttleable (sampling).

### Negative
- Eventual-consistency UX: the reflection appears slightly after submission; the client must handle the update.
- A moderation fail policy is required (fail-open vs fail-safe per content type, open question in Phase 0).

### Risks to monitor
- Queue backlog at the daily spike; mitigated by Fargate autoscaling and Batch API for non-urgent work.
