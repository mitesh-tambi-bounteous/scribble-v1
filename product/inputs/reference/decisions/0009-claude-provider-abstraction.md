# ADR 0009: Provider-abstraction layer for Claude (Direct API default)

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2026-06-10
**Deciders:** David Lawton, Rob Forshier II (input from the AWS conversation, 2026-06-13)
**Related:** [../architecture-plan.md](../architecture-plan.md) §7, [../technical-implementation-plan.md](../technical-implementation-plan.md) §9.7, [../discussion-topics.md](../discussion-topics.md)

## Context

How Claude is hosted (Direct Anthropic API vs AWS Bedrock vs Claude Platform on AWS) is unresolved and tied to the AWS co-funding conversation. AWS may want Claude on Bedrock as a condition of co-funding. The concern raised internally is feature/caching parity; Bedrock serves the same Messages API shape, but prompt caching can break if tooling mutates prompt headers. We cannot let this decision block the build.

## Decision

We will route all Claude access through **one internal provider-abstraction layer** (`generate`, `moderate`, `describe_image`) with adapters for Direct Anthropic API, AWS Bedrock, and Claude Platform on AWS, selectable by configuration. The recommended **default is the Direct Anthropic API**. Because the abstraction turns an unresolved, externally-driven hosting decision into a config switch, protecting the September 15 date regardless of how AWS co-funding lands.

## Alternatives considered

### Option A: Commit to Direct Anthropic API now
- Pros: simplest; cleanest caching; cleanest Anthropic reference story.
- Cons: AWS co-funding may require in-AWS billing later, forcing a change.
- Why not chosen as sole path: the abstraction keeps Direct as default while preserving optionality at near-zero cost.

### Option B: Commit to Bedrock now
- Pros: strongest AWS alignment; in-VPC data path.
- Cons: caching nuance; weaker Anthropic-reference framing; decision not yet made.
- Why not chosen as sole path: premature before the AWS conversation.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Hosting becomes a config decision, not a rewrite.
- One home for model selection, caching, and token-cost logging.

### Negative
- A thin layer of indirection over the SDK.

### Risks to monitor
- Adapter request-shape divergence breaking Bedrock prompt caching. Keep request shapes clean; verify cache-read tokens on each adapter.
