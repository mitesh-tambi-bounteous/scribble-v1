## What Scribl Does

Scribl is a creativity platform with an existing enterprise motion (facilitated workshops and team events). The D2C initiative is a net-new consumer growth engine designed to prove daily habit formation, viral growth mechanics, and monetization at consumer scale — proof points needed for the next fundraise.

Their positioning: **"AI powers everything else. Scribl empowers people."** AI generates the prompt; humans make the art. Scribl is explicitly anti-noise, anti-algorithm, pro-human expression.

## The Opportunity — D2C Mobile App (MLP)

Scribl wants to build and launch a Direct-to-Consumer mobile app centered on a **daily creative practice** — inspired by the habit-forming dynamics of Wordle, NYT Games, and BeReal. The target launch is **September 15, 2026** (beta August 2026).

### Core product loops

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Daily Prompt | One universal prompt delivered to all users simultaneously — powered by Claude |
| Creative Response | Drawing canvas, short text story, or voice memo (intentionally constrained) |
| Submit to Unlock | Users see others' responses only after submitting their own — a core design principle |
| Social Channels | 4 private channels per user: Personal Archive, Family, Friends, Co-Workers |
| Reactions | Lightweight sentiment emoji reactions (no public feed, no algorithmic discovery) |
| Streaks and Progression | Badges, milestones, retention loops — same psychological model as Duolingo |
| Push Notifications | Daily prompt reminder, friend activity, momentum-based re-engagement |
| Personalized Follow-ups | AI-powered follow-ups based on stories shared (stretch feature) |

### Internal data goals (MVP)
- Retention and habit formation metrics
- Prompt engagement (open, completion, time spent)
- Social and viral growth signals (share rates, K-factor)
- Early monetization signals (premium intent, AI feature engagement)

## Partnership Structure

| Partner | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Bounteous | Primary build partner, **on-spec arrangement** — build resources committed in exchange for future economic participation, not T&M billing |
| Anthropic | AI infrastructure — Claude powers prompt generation, content moderation, and future conversational features |
| AWS | Cloud infrastructure, scalability, CDK architecture. AWS code coaching is **funded and active** |

The on-spec terms are being finalized as of June 2026. Scope, milestones, and economic participation are defined in a partnership SOW.

## Technology Stack (Defined in PRFAQ)

- **Mobile:** iOS (Swift) + Android (Kotlin), React Native shared component layer
- **Backend:** AWS (compute, storage, database), infrastructure-as-code via AWS CDK
- **AI:** Anthropic Claude API — prompt generation, content moderation, future conversational features
- **Real-time:** WebSocket for event mode; async push notification infrastructure for habit loop
- **Security:** E2E encryption in transit; AES-256 at rest; AWS CloudTrail audit logging
- **Scale target:** Daily consumer habit traffic plus enterprise event-mode spikes (up to 2,000 concurrent users per event)

## Business Context and Strategic Rationale

**Why Scribl is doing this now:**
1. Bounteous partnership de-risks the build cost
2. AWS and Anthropic infrastructure partnerships are in place
3. The "AI-exhausted" consumer moment is at peak — window to establish daily habit is now

**Scribl's fundraise story:** D2C MLP retention curves (available October 2026) are the primary proof point for the October-December 2026 angel investor pitch window. This is not a distraction from fundraising; it IS the fundraise story.

**Enterprise flywheel:** D2C consumer adoption creates pre-sold enterprise customers at zero sales cost. Active enterprise pilots include EY, CVS/Aetna, and Go Health.

**Investment requirement (Scribl's cash):**
- $50K: Agentic architecture validation
- $15-20K: Go-to-market (PR, launch campaign)
- AWS code coaching: funded separately through AWS partnership
- Total: approximately $70K for a fully built, publicly launched consumer app

### Key success metrics

| Metric | Target |
| --- | --- |
| DAU by end of beta | 1,000 |
| DAU by 90 days post-launch | 10,000 |
| Day 7 retention | ≥40% |
| Prompt completion rate | ≥70% |
| Social sharing rate | ≥60% of responses |
| Viral K-factor at 90 days | ≥1.0 |
| Free-to-paid conversion (30 days) | 5-10% |

## Our Engagement Goals

Beyond the standard build partner role, we want to use this project to:

1. **Prove the ARC/AI-SDLC methodology end-to-end** — build this app from requirements through delivery using our AI-augmented development process as a live reference implementation
2. **Leverage Claude in the product** — Claude is already in the tech stack for prompt generation; we want to deepen that integration to create a compelling case for Anthropic funding and a public reference customer story
3. **AWS co-funding angle** — AWS code coaching is already funded; there may be additional co-investment opportunity given the consumer scale story
4. **Make this fundable from Anthropic** — deep Claude integration in the consumer product creates a public reference story for Anthropic's own developer marketing
