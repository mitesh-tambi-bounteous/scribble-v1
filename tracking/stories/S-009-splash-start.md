# S-009 -- Splash / Start screen

The splash/start screen is the branded entry into the daily loop after
onboarding. It is a hero screen: the scribl wordmark/logo sits centered on a
dark screen with a single "Start" button that drops the user into the loop.

## AC

- [ ] A named "Start" button navigates to Today's Prompt (`app/index.tsx`).
- [ ] This is a hero screen: the fidelity pass centers the scribl brand mark on
  a dark theme matching the rest of the flow (centered wordmark/logo, dark
  background).
- [ ] The screen ships first as a skeleton with working navigation, then the
  design fidelity follows in a later pass.
- [ ] The screen renders and behaves identically on the web export and on an
  iOS/Android device or simulator from the single Expo/React Native codebase.
