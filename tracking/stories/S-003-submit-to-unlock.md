# S-003 -- Submit-to-unlock data-layer invariant

The launch-blocking invariant: the channel wall (feed) stays gated until the user
submits their own response for the day. Enforced at the data layer, not only in
the UI.

**Shipped** in commit `d2e5c59` (#4): server-side gate in
`backend/lambda/handlers/channel-responses.ts` driven by `getSubmission` logic
from DynamoDB/Postgres client; test `tests/submit-to-unlock.test.ts` verifies
pre-submit denies access (403) and post-submit unlocks feed. See also ADR
`decisions/0007-submit-to-unlock-data-layer.md`.

## AC

- [x] Before submitting, the channel wall is not readable: the feed query/state
  returns no other-user responses for the day.
- [x] After a successful submit, the same query unlocks and returns the channel
  responses.
- [x] The gate is enforced in the data layer (thin client / state invariant), so
  it cannot be bypassed by navigating directly to the wall route.
- [x] A test asserts: pre-submit feed is empty/locked AND post-submit feed is
  populated/unlocked.
