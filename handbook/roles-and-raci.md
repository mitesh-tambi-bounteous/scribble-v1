# Roles and Responsibilities

Who does what on scribl. This is a small POC team, so one person often wears
several hats. The point of naming roles is not to build a hierarchy: it is to
make sure each responsibility has an owner and nothing falls through the gaps.

## Core roles

- **Product owner.** Owns and prioritizes the backlog, speaks for the user,
  defines goals and success criteria, and accepts or rejects delivered work.
  Best when a single person owns the decisions. On scribl this maps to whoever
  sets what the next stories should be.
- **Scrum master / delivery lead.** Facilitates the ceremonies, keeps the board
  honest, clears blockers, and protects the team's commitment. Represents the
  team's perspective back to the product owner and stakeholders. Keep this
  separate from the product owner to avoid the conflict between what is wanted
  and what the team can take on.
- **Delivery team.** The cross-functional group building the product --
  engineering, design, QA. Self-organizes to turn committed work into a working
  increment. Empowered to make quick calls and adapt.
- **Stakeholders.** Anyone with a stake in the outcome. They give feedback at
  reviews and get a clear line of sight into progress. One stakeholder with
  final decision power should be reachable.

Larger Bounteous engagements also lean on business-unit and competency leads
(architecture, design, program direction) as coaches and escalation points. On
a POC this team, those show up as an occasional escalation path rather than
standing roles.

## What the delivery lead actively drives

The delivery lead earns the title by facilitating, not spectating:

- Runs standup tight -- three questions, no solutioning, park the deep dives.
- Enforces work-in-progress limits: keep the Now column small.
- Asks why cards pile up in review or QA, and what will move them.
- At planning, confirms real capacity (time off included), reviews how the last
  iteration went, and holds the line on a realistic commitment.
- Controls scope once an iteration starts: nothing new gets pulled in unless
  something of equal size that has not been started comes out.
- Watches the trend against the commitment and fine-tunes as needed.

## Shared responsibilities

Everyone on the team owns the outcome, not just their slice:

- Know the work. Understand the scope and the approach; focus on what was
  actually committed.
- Raise your hand early when anything threatens delivery, project or personal.
- Agree ways of working up front and keep them current (see
  `team-chartering.md`).
- Set expectations with stakeholders from the start; no surprises.
- Assume positive intent. Ask questions. Do what you say. Deliver excellence
  without gold-plating beyond what was asked.

## RACI for the core ceremonies and artifacts

R = responsible (does the work), A = accountable (owns the outcome),
C = consulted, I = informed. Collapse roles onto real people as the team's size
requires.

| Refinement | C | A | R | I |
| Estimation | C | C | A/R | I |
| Planning and the commitment | C | A | R | I |
| Daily standup | I | A | R | - |
| The board (`tracking/board.md`) | I | A | R | I |
| Story files (`tracking/stories/`) | C | A | R | I |
| Review / demo | C | A | R | C |
| Retrospective | I | A | R | - |
| Accept / reject delivered work | A/R | C | I | C |
| Definition of Ready and Done | C | A | R | I |
