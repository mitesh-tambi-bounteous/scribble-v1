# Review -- Future Backlog planning (2026-07-08)

## What happened
Added a `## Future Backlog` section to `tracking/roadmap.md`, covering the
remaining production-scope work identified in the POC gap report and the
full-app spec's out-of-POC seams: AWS production infra, app-store release
pipeline, managed push, analytics warehouse, Claude vision reflection,
Bedrock adapter, premium/paywall, enterprise admin, event mode, and the
booster-pack marketplace. Tablet support flagged as a scope decision pending,
not a committed epic, per the open question in the brief. Included a short
Jira-seeding note. Ran `docs:sync` to regenerate `docs/roadmap.md`, then
`docs:build` to confirm the site builds cleanly.

## What went well
- The gap report and full-app spec already enumerated the out-of-scope
  surface cleanly, so no scope had to be invented -- straight transcription
  into epic/feature groupings.
- `docs/roadmap.md`'s existing sidebar entry (under Tracking) already covers
  the new section; no `sidebar.mts`/`config.ts` change was needed since this
  is a section within an existing page, not a new page.

## What took too long / friction
- First `docs:build` failed because `node_modules` wasn't installed in this
  fresh worktree (`vitepress: command not found`) -- needed `npm install`
  first. Worth noting in the harness bootstrap docs for new worktrees.
- `docs:sync` also picked up unrelated pre-existing drift in `docs/board.md`
  and several story pages (S-003, S-004, S-005, S-013, S-020/21/22) reflecting
  source changes already committed to `tracking/` but not yet synced to
  `docs/`. Left them in since they're accurate and harmless, but it means
  this PR's diff is larger than just the roadmap change.

## Change to the playbook
None needed -- the roadmap/docs-sync convention worked as documented.
