# Review: B2 poc-build (Increment 1 planning)

## What went well

- Parallel exploration of the design inputs let us build a screen inventory
  quickly rather than reading each input in sequence.
- The design flow png gave a clean, unambiguous screen inventory to work from.
- The S-001 story format was easy to replicate across screens once the first
  one was in place.
- The three-tier operating model read clearly: the methodology engine -> brain
  -> MobileApp, with each tier owning a distinct concern.

## What took too long

- The primary friction: there is NO command that generates POC-BUILD screen
  stories from design inputs. `/project-poc-backlog` is an H1 DELIVERY backlog
  (it converts an accepted POC into a structured delivery backlog);
  `/project-poc-build` builds code. Neither turns a design flow diagram plus
  scope docs into per-screen B2 build stories, so this increment authored the
  per-screen stories by hand.

## What to change in the playbook

- Propose a new command, for example `/project-poc-stories <project>`, OR a B2
  extension, that reads the design inputs under `s2d/inputs/` and emits
  per-screen build stories in the S-0XX format. Each emitted story should carry
  the universal AC: nav wiring, web plus device parity, a design-fidelity note,
  and skeleton-first sequencing.
- This is the candidate FIRST back-flow to the methodology engine. (If this is
  methodology friction, edit the methodology engine and flag a back-flow PR --
  but not in this increment.)
- See the sibling back-flow proposal: `reviews/backflow-multi-repo-model.md`.

## Learnings captured

- `patterns/multi-repo-roled-brain.md` -- one brain owning the contract while
  driving N roled code repos.
